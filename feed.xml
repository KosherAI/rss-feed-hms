      <title>That's What Made Me a Chabadnik</title>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My mother fled from Germany to Argentina in 1940, and my father arrived there after the war, as a survivor of the Nazi labor camps. In Argentina they met and married and, although it wasn’t common there in those years, they built a traditionally observant Jewish home together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother and I went to the Chofetz Chaim school in Buenos Aires, and attended Ezra, a religious youth group. Growing up at home, I would hear about different &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; streams – like Karlin, Lizhensk, and so on – but the first time I heard about Chabad was at a Passover Seder, when I was eleven or so. My parents used to invite guests who didn’t have a Seder of their own, including non-observant people, and someone remarked that “Lubavitcher &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; know how to talk to the non-religious, and to bring them closer to Judaism.” This, I understood, was what made Lubavitch unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next year at school, I began studying with Rabbi Berel Baumgarten, who had moved to Argentina as an emissary of the Lubavitcher Rebbe about ten years before and was teaching at my school. It was 1967, before the Six Day War, and I remember how worried everyone was for Israel. They thought there was going to be another Holocaust, G-d forbid, and they wanted to do something to help. Rabbi Baumgarten spoke to us about the &lt;em&gt;tefillin &lt;/em&gt;campaign the Rebbe had recently launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For every Jew who puts on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;,” he said, “there’s a soldier in Israel being protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard, as a twelve-year-old, that a great Jewish leader had come out with such a clear message – there was something we could do, and the way to have an impact is through Torah and &lt;em&gt;mitzvot &lt;/em&gt;– it ignited a fire in me. Together with a friend, I began going out every Sunday to help other Jews put on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;. This was my first real connection to the activities of Lubavitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years later, I was in high school, studying secular subjects in the morning and learning Torah with Rabbi Baumgarten in the afternoons&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;I really wanted to learn Jewish subjects for the entire day but my mother very much wanted me to finish high school. Leaving high school seemed impossible, but something pushed me to ask the Rebbe about it – I had a sense that he was someone that even a fourteen-year-old boy from Argentina could write to. So without telling my parents or Rabbi Baumgarten, I went to the post office and mailed off a letter to the Rebbe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month later, I got an answer, signed personally by the Rebbe. He didn’t mention anything about leaving school. He just encouraged me to be diligent in my fulfillment of the &lt;em&gt;mitzvot&lt;/em&gt;, to “increase in the diligent study of Torah,” and to recite the daily portion of Psalms every morning after prayers. “This is the way to receive blessings in what you need,” he concluded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how it happened, but by the end of the year, my parents decided to give me permission to go to &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;full time. My uncle went to New York to find a suitable placefor me, accompanied by Rabbi Baumgarten. Initially, my father had them visit a few Hungarian-style &lt;em&gt;yeshiva&lt;/em&gt;s. But those charged high tuition and had all kinds of conditions and concerns about taking in a young boy from Argentina. When my uncle and Rabbi Baumgarten went to Crown Heights, the Lubavitcher &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;saw a boy who wanted to learn Torah, and decided to take me in without any conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived as an outsider, as someone with an appreciation for Chabad and its outreach work, but with a different background and a different set of customs. I would have remained that way, if I hadn’t started learning &lt;em&gt;Chasidut&lt;/em&gt;. There, I discovered a new world and began to appreciate a new dimension of Judaism. That was what made me into a Chabadnik. I also began to attend the Rebbe’s &lt;em&gt;farbrengens&lt;/em&gt;, and although I didn’t understand everything he said, I felt the atmosphere right away: It was like being in a world of spirituality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight years passed, and I was still studying in 770, when Rabbi Baumgarten passed away. Rabbi Hodakov, the Rebbe’s secretary, called me and another Argentine &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;student to his office. He said that the Rebbe wanted us to contact the community in Argentina to find out the activities Rabbi Baumgarten had been involved in. Passover was two months away, so he especially wanted to see what had to be arranged to make sure that everybody had &lt;em&gt;matzah&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Hodakov also said that the community in Argentina should advise as to who should take over Rabbi Baumgarten’s place. They soon suggested me, so Rabbi Hodakov advised me to write to the Rebbe if I felt ready to accept the offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the Rebbe thinks that I am appropriate for this position and if this is the Rebbe’s will,” I wrote to him in a letter, then I was ready to devote myself to the position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reply, the Rebbe circled the part about being fit for the position, indicating his approval, and added: “Find a &lt;em&gt;shidduch&lt;/em&gt;, and then go on &lt;em&gt;shlichut&lt;/em&gt;.” First I had to get married, and then I could become an emissary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after that, a matchmaker suggested the name of my wife, Shterna Kazarnovsky, and we became engaged before Passover. The Rebbe sent me back to Argentina for the holiday, and after our wedding that summer, my wife and I had a brief audience with the Rebbe where we received his blessings and encouragement. We were still very young – I was twenty-three, my wife nineteen – but we were now emissaries of the Rebbe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days, the Jewish community in Argentina was very warm, but there was a lot of ignorance about traditional religious observance. So we worked hard to promote Torah and &lt;em&gt;mitzvot&lt;/em&gt; in the Jewish schools of Buenos Aires as well as in the provinces. We distributed &lt;em&gt;matzot&lt;/em&gt;, we set up &lt;em&gt;sukkot &lt;/em&gt;in the schools, and in 1980 we held a parade on Lag B’Omer for a thousand Jewish children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People didn’t always recognize the work we were doing, however, which sometimes bothered me. A few years after we arrived in Argentina, there was a meeting of the religious members of AMIA (Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina), a local communal organization. They were worried about assimilation among the Jews of Argentina, and a very prominent member of the group remarked that “nobody is doing anything about it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time I sent a report to the Rebbe describing all of our activities, I mentioned this incident, and how dispiriting that comment had been. “How could anyone say that nobody is doing anything?” I wrote. “We are doing so much!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his reply, the Rebbe addressed only this point, expressing his surprise that it had made me feel so down. “It is almost certain,” he wrote, that the reason they have woken up to the issue of assimilation is because they are “envious of your work. And this is easy to understand.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years since we moved to Argentina, Chabad has had an impact on the entire Jewish community there, and others have adopted our approach to outreach – which I understand as a sign that we are on the right path. That is what the Rebbe was telling me: Instead of feeling bad that our work isn’t being recognized, I should recognize that others are being inspired by our efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Tzvi Grunblatt is the director of Chabad in Argentina, which today includes approximately sixty institutions across the country. He was interviewed in October 2016 and November 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>My mother came from a Lubavitcher family, that had lived in the chasidic village of Schedrin for generations, and arrived in America with her mother in the 1920s, when she was a little girl. They had intended to go to Brownsville, Brooklyn, but they took the wrong boat and wound up in Brownsville...</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My mother came from a Lubavitcher family, that had lived in the &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; village of Schedrin for generations, and arrived in America with her mother in the 1920s, when she was a little girl. They had intended to go to Brownsville, Brooklyn, but they took the wrong boat and wound up in Brownsville, Texas. Seeing that they didn’t belong there, the immigration authorities deported them across the border, and they had to hitchhike 1,000 kilometers to Mexico City. They spent the next few years there, until they straightened out their papers and made it to Brownsville – in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my father was a Gerrer&lt;em&gt; chasid&lt;/em&gt; from Poland. He survived the war as a slave laborer, first in the local munitions factory and then in Germany, and was eventually liberated from the Buchenwald concentration camp. After spending a couple of years in a Displaced Persons’ camp, he made it to the United States. They married in 1952, and I was born a year later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time came, because of my parents’ different backgrounds, there was a discussion about which schoolI would go to. My grandmother immediately said that I should go to Lubavitch, and ultimately my father agreed. So I went to Lubavitcher Yeshivafor elementary school and high school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no such thing as a “gap year” in those days, but after high school I spent a year studying Torah full-time at the Tomchei Tmimim &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;on Ocean Parkway, in Flatbush. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, both of my parents came from completely religious homes, and had no doubts about raising me to be observant on a day-to-day basis. However, even though the Rebbe would often discourage &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;students from attending college, they came to the conclusion that I needed to go to college after &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother had been widowed back in Russia and remarried after coming to America. Her second husband was a Lubavitcher, and his son – my mother’s step-brother – was a Torah-observant professor of engineering at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. He also worked for NASA, on the Mercury and Gemini space programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sender Yona went to college, and he’s a religious Jew,” his father, my mother’s step-father, told me. “And you’re at least as bright as Sender Yona,” he added, which may or may not have been true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a good boy, so I agreed to try and get into aeronautical engineering, but I wasn’t going to do anything until I received the Rebbe’s blessing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my father had fallen seriously sick. He had been hospitalized for a number of health issues, mostly connected to his heart and lungs, but his condition deteriorated to the point that the doctors said that there wasn’t a lot they could do for him. “Let him go home,” they basically said, “and whatever happens, happens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 1971, in honor of my birthday, I was able to have an audience with the Rebbe. I prepared a note for the Rebbe beforehand in which I wrote about my father’s condition, of course, and about college. I didn’t even ask whether I should go to college; it was a given that I would go. I just wrote what my parents wanted for me and assumed that the Rebbe would give his blessing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparing me for the audience, my friends told me that the Rebbe would look at me when I came into his room, and then read my note while marking it up with a pencil. Then he would answer me, and watch me as I walked out of the room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I opened the door and walked in, at about 2:00 AM, I noticed that the Rebbe was looking down, his beard pressed against his jacket. Without picking up his head, the Rebbe took my note from me, made his marks, and asked me whether I was called up to the Torah that past Shabbat – as is the Chabad custom before a birthday. He then gave me a blessing for success and a blessing for my father as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the volume of his voice picking up suddenly and dramatically, he added: “You should go to learn in a &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;next year, and that will help your father, too!” He said those words so forcefully, he was practically yelling. He was still looking down, but I understood that the meeting was over, and so I backed out of the room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the Q train to Brighton Beach, where we lived at the time, and got home at about 3:00 AM. Everybody was asleep, so I went straight to bed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I woke up late the next morning, neither of my parents were home. My father owned a butcher’s shop, which my mother had taken over during his illness, so I went there and asked her about my father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you know what happened?” she asked. I didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s better!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a double take. “What?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father had woken up that morning feeling fine, and went straight to the doctor to get everything checked out. He was still at the doctor’s office when I went to the store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe had told me that I should go to &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;and that would help my father – and it was as though I received the reward before I even did anything. It wasn’t a complete recovery, but we did have a few more years with him, until his passing five years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, I decided not to tell my parents what the Rebbe had said; I only told them that I was going to &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;for another year – without putting it on the Rebbe. At that moment, keeping this information to myself seemed like the right thing to do. They weren’t thrilled that I wasn’t going to college, but I did what I had to do, and the next year I went to the Tomchei Temimim &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; in Morristown, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of that year, I decided that I wanted to stay in &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; for longer, and when my next birthday rolled around, in 1972, I came for another audience with the Rebbe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, when I knocked on the door and walked in, the Rebbe was looking at me with the warmest smile I ever saw. He watched me as I walked from the door to his desk, smiling all the while – except for when he looked down to read the note I handed to him. Even when he answered me, he smiled as he spoke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe actually talked to me for a while, and several times, I heard the door open and close, as the secretary checked in to make sure that I wasn’t just eating up everyone else’s time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was finally time for me to leave, the Rebbe kept on smiling at me as I walked all the way to the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I didn’t go to college at all. Instead, after I got married, I took a few computer programming courses. I have been in that field since 1981, and things ended up working out just fine. Actually, around the time that I got married and was looking for work, there was a dip in government contracts for aeronautical engineers. So, had I become one – like Sender Yonah – it would not have helped much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While working as a software engineer, Rabbi Kalman Shor has also been teaching Torah classes and providing other community services at Chabad of Henderson, Nevada, since 2003. He was interviewed in December 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Concentration Camp Promises Kept</title>

      <description>I was born in the Carpathian mountain region – which was a part of the Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia and is now part of Ukraine – to a religious Jewish family that had managed to survive the Holocaust.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I was born in the Carpathian mountain region – which was a part of the Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia and is now part of Ukraine – to a religious Jewish family that had managed to survive the Holocaust. Although my parents could have emigrated right after the war because they had relatives in America, they stayed out of loyalty to an ailing aunt, and they missed their chance to leave. After that, the border was closed and getting out became impossible. Only in 1972, after my uncle pressed officials he knew to lobby the Nixon administration, were we finally able to emigrate. By then, I had already graduated college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived in America – in Los Angeles – my father saw that his relatives here were not Torah observant, and he was very concerned. Despite great obstacles, our family had kept Shabbat and kosher in Czechoslovakia. “I didn’t come here for this,” he said. “I want my kids to grow up religious.” This was especially important to him because, while he was incarcerated in a Nazi concentration camp, he made a promise to G-d that if He got him out alive, he would always keep the Torah and would make sure his children did as well. He was not about to renege on that promise, not after G-d also liberated him from what he called “Soviet hell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He confided his concerns in Rabbi Naftali Estulin, the Chabad emissary to the Russian community in LA, who promised him that he would arrange for me and my siblings to be sent to New York to spend time in a religious environment there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True to his word, Rabbi Estulin put us all – me, my siblings and my cousins – on a bus, which belonged to the Chabad House, for the cross-country trek from Los Angeles to New York. But in Arizona the bus broke down. Dismayed, some of my cousins weren’t willing to continue; they just wanted to turn around and go back home. Unsure what to do, Rabbi Estulin called the Rebbe who told him to send us on a plane; Chabad would pay for the tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is how I came to attend Chabad’s Camp Emunah – not as a camper, but as a helper – and, after the summer was over, I enrolled in the Chabad school, Bais Rivka in Crown Heights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first applied to Bais Rivka, I was brought to meet the Rebbe. I didn’t understand who he was – I thought he was just another rabbi. Even when I first spoke with him, I saw him as a grandfather figure, because I never knew any of my grandparents, all of whom had perished in the war. In fact, none of my friends had grandparents; they were all gone. And so that is who he seemed to me – the grandfather I never had. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only when I got older that I realized that the Rebbe was much more than a grandfather – he was a holy soul – and then I was in awe of him. But not so when I first met him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that meeting, the Rebbe asked me about my plans. I didn’t yet have my green card which would have enabled me to work in the United States, but this did not matter to me because I preferred to continue studying and I told him that. “Do you truly want to learn,” he asked, “or do you want to stay in school because you have nothing better to do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I truly want to learn,” I replied. He was pleased with that and wished me much success. I then mentioned my concern about the cost of room and board, but he just said “Don’t worry.” And that’s how I went off to study at Bais Rivka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While studying there, I met my darling husband, Zalman, and before the wedding – which took place in 1973 – we were able to get a blessing from the Rebbe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zalman and I were a perfect match. We shared a similar background and outlook. Although he was born in California, his parents were Czech Jews who had survived the Holocaust and who had settled in the same neighborhood as we did in Los Angeles. While we both gravitated toward &lt;em&gt;Yiddishkeit&lt;/em&gt; and gained a great deal by learning in Chabad schools in New York, neither of us liked the city much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before either of us mentioned a word about that, the Rebbe told us, “You should know that Chabad is expanding on the West Coast, and it would be good for you to be there.” Zalman was particularly thrilled about that, and it turned out well for us – we were able to be quite successful in Jewish outreach in LA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Rebbe started talking with me in Russian about my younger sister Luba. Before the audience, I had written him a note telling him that, before we emigrated, Luba had received a marriage proposal from a young man – Eliya Kleiman – who also planned to emigrate, but so far had been unable to get permission. She really wanted to marry him, but feared he might never be allowed to leave, so she didn’t know what to do – should she wait for him or end the relationship?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe replied that Luba should wait because this young man would come out soon – he’d be able to immigrate to Israel, and they would be able to get married. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make sure that I heard correctly, so the Rebbe repeated himself, speaking Russian: “&lt;em&gt;Da, Da&lt;/em&gt;. He is going to be let out soon. Don’t worry, and everything will be okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I told my sister what the Rebbe had said, she got very excited. And after just a few months, he made it out. Exactly a year after Zalman and I got married – on the very same day, twelve months later – Luba and Elya got married in Israel. It all happened just like the Rebbe said it would. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mrs. Esther Roth is a mother of fifteen children, as well as a grandmother and a great-grandmother. She was interviewed together with her husband Mr. Zalman Roth in January 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Guess Who I Prank Called</title>

      <description>I used to love coming to 770 as a young boy whenever the Rebbe held a late-night farbrengen , because it meant that I could stay up instead of going to bed on time.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I used to love coming to 770 as a young boy whenever the Rebbe held a late-night &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;, because it meant that I could stay up instead of going to bed on time. I knew the Rebbe was a great man, but I was a naive kid and didn’t really understand all of the things he was saying. So while he would be delivering these groundbreaking talks about how we have to better our lives, I would be sitting under the bleachers with my cousins, tying people’s shoelaces together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the 1970s, and although I was growing up in Flatbush, I attended the Lubavitcher Yeshiva in Crown Heights: My uncle, Dr. Moshe Feldman, served as a physician for the Lubavitch community and he influenced my parents to send me to that &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt;. I would also get in trouble there, because I was a troublemaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My antics were mostly harmless practical jokes, which I did because I was trying to be funny, not to hurt anybody. They used to tell stories about a man named Reb Hershel of Ostropol, who was like the jester in the &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; court of Rabbi Boruch of Mezhibuzh, and I think every generation has its pranksters. So I was just carrying on that tradition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways my cousins and I would be mischievous was by making prank calls. One day in the early ‘80s, when I was eleven, we were playing in my uncle’s office, and saw a note. It said “Schneerson, 1304 President Street,” and underneath that was a phone number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked at each other. “Schneerson… that’s the Rebbe’s house!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then my cousin gave me another look. He wasn’t as mischievous as I was, but he was a good instigator. “I dare you to call it.” I called the number. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sweet old woman answered the phone – and I got scared. Instead of saying anything, I just made some animal noises, mooing like a cow for a few seconds, and then I hung up the phone. Five minutes later, I did it again, although this time I made some goat sounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About six months later, it was Sukkot, in the intermediate days of the festival, and I was back at my uncle’s house. Our family was getting ready to have lunch together, so they were all outside in the &lt;em&gt;sukkah &lt;/em&gt;when I was sent back into the house for some napkins and cups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went back into the house, the red phone was ringing: Aside from the regular house phone, my uncle had a red phone reserved for medical emergencies. Only a few people in the community had the number for the red phone, and we children were instructed to never play with it, or even to touch it. But since it was ringing and no one else was in the house, I decided to answer it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also decided to answer it like an idiot: “&lt;em&gt;Helloooooo,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;who is it?&lt;/em&gt;” I inquired, in a ridiculous, high-pitched voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman on the other end was slightly taken aback. “I’m sorry,” she said. “I must have called the wrong number. I’m trying to reach Dr. Feldman.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But this is Dr. Feldman’s house,” I replied. “He’s just outside, in the &lt;em&gt;sukkah&lt;/em&gt;, and I can go get him for you. Who’s calling please?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is Mrs. Schneerson from President Street,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay, hold on a minute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to my uncle and told him who was on the phone, and he ran into the house. A minute later, he came back out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How dare you?” he fumed. “I’ve told you so many times not to ever play games on the red phone. If somebody is calling that phone, it could be a life-threatening emergency and you could be delaying their medical care with your jokes. Do you know who was on the phone now?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mrs. Schneerson from President Street?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t be a wise guy! That was the Rebbetzin! She’s not feeling well and she asked me to come over. Now get your coat because you’re coming along. She wants to meet you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was terrified. As we began walking, my uncle added: “And how dare you make prank calls to her!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How does he know about that?,&lt;/em&gt; I wondered, but I got my answer before I could ask. “The Rebbetzin recognized your voice! ‘That’s the little boy who called me a few months ago, once as a cow and another time as a goat,’ she said!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m going to be punished in ways I don’t even comprehend,&lt;/em&gt; I thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to the Rebbe’s house, the door was unlocked. My uncle just turned the knob, we walked inside, and he started going up the staircase to the right, before turning back to me. “You stay right over there,” he warned. “Don’t touch anything!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he walked up, the Rebbetzin appeared at the top of the staircase. She looked down, smiled at me, and waved. I waved back, and she disappeared back into a room, with my uncle behind her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s it? &lt;/em&gt;I wondered. &lt;em&gt;She just wanted to wave? That’s not so bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around to see a man standing there with a stern look in his eye. His name was Gansburg, as I later found out, and he worked as an assistant in the Rebbe’s house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you Moshe?” he queried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes.” A sense of dread came over me: &lt;em&gt;He must be the executioner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come with me, please.” Shalom Ber Gansburg led me though the living room, into the kitchen, past the bright orange and yellow floral trim on top of the kitchen wallpaper, and through a door at the back of the kitchen. The door led directly into a &lt;em&gt;sukkah&lt;/em&gt;, where a table was set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Rebbetzin prepared lunch for you,” he informed me. “Please sit down and enjoy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two &lt;em&gt;challah &lt;/em&gt;rolls, salad, a piece of baked salmon, and a cup of orange juice – already poured and ready to drink. I still remember how delicious it all was. As I sat there and ate, I mused about this unexpected turn of events. I thought I was going to be severely punished for my little joke, and now I had been invited into the Rebbe’s private &lt;em&gt;sukkah&lt;/em&gt;, to eat a meal that the Rebbetzin had prepared! I don’t know of anyone else in the community who had ever received such an honor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m going to brag to all of my friends about this, &lt;/em&gt;I gloated inside.&lt;em&gt; I’m the man!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the moral of the story is about the character of the Rebbetzin. I was mischievous, but she saw the bigger picture and knew that I really wasn’t a bad kid; I was just trying to be funny. I think she had a sense of humor about it too. So even though she wasn’t feeling well, she went out of her way to make sure I had a nice lunch to eat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I’m still inspired by the act of kindness and love that the Rebbetzin showed me so many years ago. She was a great woman and she loved all of us, like a grandmother loves her grandkids even when they make trouble. Maybe that is how G-d loves all of us, even though at times we don’t do what we’re supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>After a serious 1985 cancer diagnosis, Rabbi Zushe Feldman received specific medical and spiritual guidance from the Lubavitcher Rebbe. By following these directives and committing to daily Torah study, he experienced a miraculous recovery just in time for the High Holidays.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rabbi Zushe Feldman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family was spending the summer of 1985 in the Catskill mountains of upstate New York, when one day, I began to experience pain. Initially, I didn’t think much of it, hoping that it would subside. However, as the days passed and the pain only intensified, I realized that I needed to see a doctor. My brother-in-law, Rabbi Yosef Wilenkin, had also become aware of my discomfort and, being more fluent in English than I was, kindly offered to accompany me to an appointment in the city. I accepted his offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a thorough examination, the doctor quickly determined that my condition was serious. Although he wasn’t a specialist in the field, he knew it was cancer. He immediately referred me to a hospital and recommended I see a particular doctor there for further testing and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my diagnosis, the whole family came back to our home in Crown Heights, and I immediately sat down to write a letter to the Rebbe, informing him of the situation and asking for his blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was set to be admitted to one of the hospitals in Brooklyn, we received a phone call from the Rebbe’s secretary, Rabbi Binyomin Klein. The Rebbe’s message was clear: “Follow the advice of Dr. Feldman.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We immediately reached out to Dr. Moshe Feldman, a local physician who was part of the Crown Heights community. As it turned out, Dr. Feldman had connections in Sloan Kettering, the top cancer treatment center in Manhattan, and he referred me there. Clearly, the Rebbe had sensed that Dr. Feldman would be the proper medical channel for my healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before long, I was admitted to the hospital and began undergoing treatment. As you can imagine, I was not in very high spirits. I found it difficult to concentrate, even on my daily Torah studies. After a week or two, my wife wrote a letter to the Rebbe to update him on my condition and, among other things, she mentioned that I was feeling very despondent about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short while later, we received an answer. The Rebbe instructed that I make sure to study the daily portions of Rambam (Maimonides’ &lt;em&gt;Mishneh Torah,&lt;/em&gt; which the Rebbe had recently divided into a study schedule) and Chitas (an acronym for &lt;em&gt;Chumash&lt;/em&gt;, meaning the Five Books of Moses, &lt;em&gt;Tehillim&lt;/em&gt;, meaning Psalms, and &lt;em&gt;Tanya&lt;/em&gt;, the classic &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; work by the Alter Rebbe.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe then quoted the verse from Psalms, “The commandments of G-d… gladden the heart,” to say that studying Torah would lift my spirits, and that “all the [positive] benefits that result from [happiness] are obvious.” The Rebbe added that he would pray at the resting place of the Previous Rebbe for my situation to be resolved with “great success” and that I should “report good news.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface, the Rebbe was addressing my mood, since learning Torah would lift my spirits. But by mentioning those other positive outcomes, along with his blessing for my recovery, I understood that all of those results would come from my meticulously learning the portions of Chitas and Rambam every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, after receiving such a clear answer, along with the Rebbe’s blessing, my spirits were very much lifted. And, as you can imagine, from that moment on I was able to concentrate fully on my daily Chitas and Rambam. Until today, I make sure to study them every single day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rabbi Mendel Feldman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several weeks passed after my father was admitted to the hospital, and with the festive Tishrei season quickly approaching, we weren’t sure if he would be discharged in time for the holidays. A week before Rosh Hashanah, the doctors still couldn’t say, and every day we were getting more and more anxious. With only a few days left, my mother wrote another letter to the Rebbe, and she asked me to deliver it to his office the next morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, I was only fifteen years old, but I can still recall bringing the letter to the office of the Rebbe’s secretariat and placing it on the pile of mail that would soon be brought in to the Rebbe’s office. I still felt uneasy – as all of us were – so about two hours later I decided to go back to 770 to see whether there might be an answer already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I walked into the building, I saw Rabbi Leibel Groner, one of the Rebbe’s secretaries, walking out of the Rebbe’s office with a pile of mail. “The Rebbe just gave me an answer for you,” he informed me. The Rebbe had written his reply on the letter I had delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t read my mother’s letter before, but now, when Rabbi Groner showed me the Rebbe’s reply, I saw that my mother had written that we were “all feeling anxious at the thought of my husband not being home for Rosh Hashanah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe circled the word “all” – “&lt;em&gt;kulam&lt;/em&gt;”in my mother’s Hebrew – and then I saw that in the margins of the letter, he had added the traditional Rosh Hashanah greeting to be “inscribed and sealed for a sweet new year.” In other words, this applied to “all” of the people my mother had referred to in her letter, especially, of course, my father. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took this as an indication that my father would be home for the holidays – and that is exactly what happened. He was home with us for Rosh Hashanah, and thank G-d, he went on to have a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Zushe Feldman has served as an educator in Oholei Torah in Crown Heights for over forty years. His son, Rabbi Mendel Feldman, is a Chabad emissary in Halifax, Nova Scotia. They were both interviewed in November 2025. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Week of My Wedding</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/680.-Bo-5786.pdf</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/680.-Bo-5786.pdf</guid>
      <description>This account follows an English student who witnessed the final years of the Previous Rebbe’s leadership firsthand. It details the year of transition and the personal stories that illustrate how the Rebbe eventually took on the responsibility of the movement.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 1947, when I was twenty-one, I came to New York from England because I wanted to learn Torah in the &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; of the Previous Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived just before Shavout and, shortly after the holiday, I had my first private audience with the Previous Rebbe, who was in very frail health by then. I don’t remember much from that meeting, but I do vividly recall one piece of advice he gave to me. He said that the focus of both my spiritual and material life must be &lt;em&gt;kabbalat ol&lt;/em&gt;, the acceptance of the yoke of the Torah’s commandments, and that I would learn the full meaning of &lt;em&gt;kabbalat ol &lt;/em&gt;from my teachers in &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt;. This I remember till this very day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, I did not meet Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson – the Rebbe’s son-in-law, who four years later would become the Rebbe – because he had gone to Europe to meet his mother. She had just arrived in Paris after having fled the Soviet Union, and he went to escort her to the United States. When they arrived, I was there at the port with a group of people who greeted them as they disembarked from the ship, and he spoke to me for the first time then, identifying me as the son of Rabbi Yitzchok Dubov, with whom he had maintained a regular correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, much of my communication with the Previous Rebbe was through the future Rebbe, who was referred to as the Ramash at the time. He was the head of the &lt;em&gt;Merkos L’Inyonei Chinuch&lt;/em&gt;, Chabad’s educational outreach arm, and although he was very busy, he made himself very accessible to us – we could come up to him and ask him anything we wanted. We would ask him about &lt;em&gt;Yiddishkeit&lt;/em&gt;, about Jewish law or Jewish customs, and even about politics – he was always willing to engage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget the time when one of the older students, Berel Chaskind, asked him why we needed Russia in the world – what was the value of Russian communism? His answer was very insightful. He said that in America, we are focused on possessions – we must have a house, a car, a refrigerator, this and that. In Russia, you don’t care about accumulating possessions because you are just satisfied with your existence. This goes to show that in the world there must be opposites, and that this is part of G-d’s plan for creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all understood that he was a person of great intelligence and vast Torah knowledge, and we saw that he worked very hard and had many responsibilities. One of these was publishing Torah books – &lt;em&gt;seforim – &lt;/em&gt;and I heard him say that before the Previous Rebbe came to America, there were few Lubavitcher &lt;em&gt;seforim&lt;/em&gt;. There was no &lt;em&gt;Siddur&lt;/em&gt;, no &lt;em&gt;Selichot&lt;/em&gt;, only incomplete &lt;em&gt;Machzorim&lt;/em&gt;, and little by little he published everything, with annotations regarding our customs. He also began to publish the discourses of the Previous Rebbe, which were voluminous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The respect he had for the Previous Rebbe was enormous. Just to give a personal example: The Previous Rebbe gave me a blessing to become a &lt;em&gt;shochet&lt;/em&gt;, a kosher ritual slaughterer, or a &lt;em&gt;mohel&lt;/em&gt;, who performs circumcisions. I became a &lt;em&gt;shochet&lt;/em&gt;, but the income from this was minimal, and I asked him later, when he became the Rebbe, if I should change my profession. His answer was: “If my father-in-law told you to become a &lt;em&gt;shochet&lt;/em&gt;, that’s what you must be.” In other words, there was nothing discuss. I did that work for twenty-five years, teaching a little on the side to make ends meet, and then I became a &lt;em&gt;mohel&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1950, I got married – it was on Wednesday, January 25th. Officiating at our wedding, as per the existing custom, was the older son-in-law of the Previous Rebbe, Rabbi Shemaryahu Gurary, known as the Rashag, with the Ramash reciting the first two blessings under the &lt;em&gt;chuppah&lt;/em&gt;. He left early because he had a standing lesson every Wednesday night and every Friday night with the Previous Rebbe which he would not miss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days later – on &lt;em&gt;Yud Shevat&lt;/em&gt;, which was Shabbat, January 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; – the Previous Rebbe passed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the week of &lt;em&gt;shivah&lt;/em&gt;, after the morning prayers, the Ramash used to tell a short story from the life of the Previous Rebbe. He did that multiple times. Then when the week was over, everyone went to the &lt;em&gt;Ohel&lt;/em&gt;, the Rebbe’s gravesite. The &lt;em&gt;Maaneh Lashon&lt;/em&gt; book – which contains passages from the &lt;em&gt;Zohar &lt;/em&gt;as well as certain psalms which are customarily recited at the gravesite of a &lt;em&gt;tzaddik – &lt;/em&gt;was not yet printed, and people didn’t know what prayers to say. So the Ramash told everyone to recite psalms and said he would recite the passages from the &lt;em&gt;Zohar&lt;/em&gt;. But there was no copy of the &lt;em&gt;Zohar&lt;/em&gt; around, so he did it from memory. This I witnessed and remember distinctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days before that, during the week of &lt;em&gt;shivah&lt;/em&gt;, he had also gone to &lt;em&gt;Ohel &lt;/em&gt;with a large group of &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt;; among them was my father, who had come for my wedding and stayed for the funeral and &lt;em&gt;shivah&lt;/em&gt;. Now my father had a straightforward way of speaking, of coming directly to the point not always diplomatically, and I heard him say to the Ramash, “Now you have to take over.” I then heard the future Rebbe answer, “How can I take over if he’s still living?” To which my father replied, “This applies to all the Rebbeim,” meaning they are all living in a spiritual sense, “but we need a Rebbe we can converse with.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There the conversation ended, and I had the impression that nothing more needed to be said – that each understood the other’s meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ramash did not formally take over for a year. During that year, many people pressed him to assume the mantle of leadership and become the Rebbe, but he always replied, “In the past I would converse with the &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;students, and I will keep doing that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What caused him to relent? So many things happened during that year, but what stands out in my memory is the day – on the first anniversary of the Previous Rebbe’s passing – when Rabbi Shlomo Aharon Kazarnovsky submitted to him a three-page list of all the &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; who wanted him to be the next Rebbe. That day, he went to the &lt;em&gt;Ohel, &lt;/em&gt;and I witnessed him crying bitterly. And then he accepted the leadership upon himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Yehuda Leib Dubov, a &lt;/em&gt;shochet&lt;em&gt; and a &lt;/em&gt;mohel&lt;em&gt;, who was a long-time resident of Crown Heights, passed away in July 2017. He was interviewed in December 2001 and August 2011.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>After surviving a devastating accident that left her with chronic pain, a mother describes how her life took an unexpected turn through her connection with the Rebbe. This account highlights her firsthand experiences with his spiritual guidance, which provided clarity and comfort during a period ...</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 1979, my husband and I were living in Cape Town, South Africa, where I worked as a teacher. One rainy night, after attending a staff meeting, my friend gave me a ride home. We were driving along a winding mountain road when suddenly we saw a car coming head-on toward us! We had the mountain on one side of us and a steep drop to the ocean on the other. There was nowhere to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I screamed at my friend to stop, but then I became calm. I knew the car was going to hit us, but I also knew without a doubt that whatever would happen was out of my control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driver crashed into the side of the car where I was sitting, and judging by the pictures of the crash scene, it was a miracle that I survived at all. I had injured the left side of my head, injured and lost use of the right side of my body. My speech was affected too, and I was left with chronic pain and severe migraines. I worked hard over a long period to regain my functions, but I remained heavily medicated, which in turn made me afraid that if I were to have children, they would be affected by all the medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1980, we immigrated to Boston, where, by a miracle, I gave birth to a baby girl, without any complications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We later moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, where my husband got a job as a pulmonologist, and we became friends with the local Chabad emissaries, Rabbi Yossi and Mariashi Groner. At one point, they invited me to come along with them to New York to get a blessing from the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not know anything about the Rebbe, but I decided to go along. My chronic pain had not gone away, and was so bad that sometimes I could not see any future for myself. I was desperate for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we saw the Rebbe, he was handing out dollars or coins for people to give to charity. I went over to him together with Rabbi Groner, who explained to the Rebbe, in Yiddish, what had happened to me and asked him for a blessing. But as they spoke, I could not look at the Rebbe; it was as though there was too much energy around him, and I had to turn my gaze downward. Rabbi Groner later told me that the Rebbe gave me a blessing to be healthy and a blessing to have children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next couple of days, I had so much energy that I was unable to fall asleep. I knew that a spiritually powerful man had given me a blessing, and I knew then that I would be okay, and my health would surely improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank G-d, I became pregnant a year later, and went on to have another three children. During all my pregnancies, I had no pain, but after each birth, the pain would return for six months or so and then gradually subside. Although the pain did not go away completely, the quality of my life improved substantially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, during one of my pregnancies, under the insistence of my obstetrician, I underwent an ultrasound. The doctor was quiet during the procedure, but afterwards he told me that we needed to follow up with further tests. The results came back positive for spina bifida, a serious condition involving a malfunction in the bones of the spine and the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I told the Groners about the diagnosis, Rabbi Groner said that whenever one has some uncertainty regarding a medical condition, they should get multiple opinions. Following his advice, I took the test results to another doctor to get his opinion, and then did a re-test with two more doctors. Without disclosing the findings of the initial test, I merely asked them to let me know their findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subsequent tests also came back positive. The doctors could not be fully certain, but all of them said that there was a very strong likelihood that my baby had spina bifida. My husband and I started to discuss the possibility of raising a child with a severe disability while managing my own health issues and trying to raise our other children, as well as thinking about how this would affect them. We had a big decision to make. Eventually, I came to a conclusion: If this is what G-d had in store for me, I would accept it and find a way to manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month or so later, at a regular prenatal appointment, the obstetrician said there were further complications. Apart from the spina bifida, I also had placenta previa, a condition in which the placenta drops, thereby blocking the cervix and preventing normal delivery. There was also a strong possibility of this causing a spontaneous abortion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Yossi Groner suggested I tell the Rebbe, so I wrote a note expressing all of my concerns. I also mentioned that I had been planning to attend a seminar in Minnesota with Rabbi Manis Friedman, a &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; lecturer, but was concerned that flying would further increase the risk of an early stillbirth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Groner sent my note to the Rebbe, and soon after, I was excited to receive a letter with his response. “You will have a healthy baby,” the Rebbe wrote, “and that child will go on to have many children and bring you a lot of &lt;em&gt;nachas&lt;/em&gt;. You must trust in G-d that things will be good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt completely reassured that everything would be alright, and from then on, I acted as any woman with a normal pregnancy would, including attending the conference in Minnesota. And, thank G-d, when the baby was born, everything was normal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two or three weeks after the birth, Mariashi Groner suggested that we go to the Rebbe to thank him for the blessing and to show him the baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, when we arrived in New York and went to 770, there was a small line of people waiting to see him near his office. I watched as the Rebbe came out and stopped to speak to the first person in line, and then moved on to the second person. “Here is the baby,” I was planning to say. “Thank you!” Then the Rebbe came to Mariashi, and she spoke to him. Once again, I felt this palpable, tremendous energy radiating from him. Then the Rebbe stood in front of me, and I looked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not expecting what happened next. As he looked at me, it was like a camera flash went off, but much deeper than that. It felt as though the Rebbe saw right through me and connected with a part of my soul that I had never connected with myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so shaken by this experience that despite what I had planned to say, I could not make a sound. The whole meeting probably took a few seconds, but since then, and through some other major life events, I have had the sense that the Rebbe was with me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Not Against, Only For</title>

      <description>An Australian student recounts traveling across the world for seminary based on the Rebbe's specific advice. She shares how his guidance shaped her marriage and her understanding of the Chabad mission: that Lubavitch is never &quot;against&quot; others, but only &quot;for&quot; spreading goodness.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I was born and raised in Australia, where my father – Rabbi Chaim Gutnick, a Chabad &lt;em&gt;chasid – &lt;/em&gt;served as the chief rabbi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When in 1965 I graduated Mount Scopus High School – a Modern Orthodox Jewish day school in Melbourne – my father felt that my education in &lt;em&gt;Yiddishkeit&lt;/em&gt; needed a boost and that I should spend a few years in a seminary. He consulted the Rebbe, proposing a list of possible options for me from which the Rebbe selected the Jewish Teachers’ Training College in Gateshead, England, where my older sister Penina had been sent the year before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a controversial choice for several reasons: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, at that time, even boys were not sent overseas to &lt;em&gt;yeshivahs&lt;/em&gt;, and to send a young girl half-way across the world was unheard of. That my father would ship off both his daughters must have seemed to people like a crazy thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, my mother missed Penina very much, and to have both daughters so far from home would be very difficult for her. But she realized that they had to treat us equally, so if Penina got to go abroad, I was entitled to the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And third, while Gateshead had an excellent reputation academically, it was not a &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; school, and some of the faculty seemed to hold a somewhat negative view of Lubavitch.However, several Lubavitcher girls were enrolled there, and the school was respectful of their customs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my way to Gateshead, I stopped off for a few months in Kfar Chabad, Israel, where a wonderful lady named Mrs. Yehudis Lison took me in, housed me, fed me and learned &lt;em&gt;chasidic &lt;/em&gt;teachings with me every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to love her and also the community in Kfar Chabad, and so I wrote to the Rebbe about it, telling him what a beautiful and spiritual place Kfar Chabad was, asking if perhaps I should stay there. He replied that my description of the village brought him much &lt;em&gt;nachat ruach&lt;/em&gt; -- pleasure, but he did not answer me directly about staying there. He only wrote, “A person should learn where their heart desires.” I took that to mean that I could stay in Kfar Chabad, but my father felt that since I had applied and been accepted to Gateshead, I needed to follow through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So off I went to Gateshead – which was then considered the best girls’ seminary in the world – and I got an excellent education there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at Gateshead, I did not write much to the Rebbe, but one of the teachers, Mrs. Chana Kievman, did write, and the Rebbe responded to her that he frequently hears from Penina, but very little from Channah. He added, “Please take good care of her.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just goes to show how the Rebbe cared about everybody. I was just a young girl, one among many children of his &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt;, yet he inquired about me and told Mrs. Kievman to take care of me. That, I have to say, is astounding. I only found out about this years later when my daughter married Mrs. Kievman’s son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing the three-year course of study at Gateshead, I traveled to New York, where I had my first audience with the Rebbe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that meeting, the Rebbe quizzed me about my education and how I was treated at the school. He asked me: “What is the attitude of the administration of Gateshead toward Lubavitch?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question took me aback. I had a great deal of gratitude to the school for the wonderful education I received there, so I didn’t want to say negative things about it and the administration’s criticism of Lubavitch. After all, they came from the Lithuanian tradition of &lt;em&gt;mitnagdim&lt;/em&gt;, who had been opponents of &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; in the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. And, although critical at times, they were also respectful – for example, they allowed us Lubavitch girls to get together and read &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; teachings on days that were special to Lubavitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, choosing my words carefully – because I did not want to make the Rebbe feel bad – I answered: “If we didn’t do anything against the administration of Gateshead, everything was good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Against?!” the Rebbe exclaimed. “The word &lt;em&gt;misnaged&lt;/em&gt; means against. Lubavitch is only for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the audience was over and I was walking out, he repeated: “Remember – &lt;em&gt;misnaged&lt;/em&gt; means against. Lubavitch is only for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are only for. Who are we against? Nobody. Instead of standing in opposition, Lubavitch is &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; spreading Torah and its &lt;em&gt;mitzvot&lt;/em&gt; and everything that is good in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in New York, I began dating for marriage, and I had a firm idea of what I wanted in a husband – he had to be a &lt;em&gt;talmid chacham&lt;/em&gt;, a Torah scholar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had picked up this attitude at Gateshead where Talmudic learning was considered the be all and end all, and where I often heard disparaging remarks that Lubavitchers are not sufficiently dedicated to Torah study because they are too busy with their outreach campaigns. The implication was that if you marry a Lubavitcher, you’re a lost cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lubavitch, of course, had a different point of view. The Rebbe often described Torah learning as the most important thing, and urged his followers to study Torah night and day. But he also felt very strongly that nowadays we don’t have the luxury of sitting in a &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; indefinitely while people are out there drowning – we have to get up and do something about it. In addition to studying Torah, we have to devote ourselves to saving Jewish souls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, coming out of Gateshead, my top priority was marrying a &lt;em&gt;talmid chacham, &lt;/em&gt;and when I was introduced to my future husband, Rabbi Sholem Ber Hecht, I wrote to the Rebbe that I had my doubts about him because, in my opinion, he hadn’t studied in &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;long enough. He was clearly a brilliant man, but I wasn’t certain that he was as big a Torah scholaras I wanted my future husband to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe replied: “Work for &lt;em&gt;Pegisha &lt;/em&gt;and you will come to learn the truth.” &lt;em&gt;Pegisha&lt;/em&gt; – which means “Encounter” – is a Chabad program where Jewish college students are invited for a weekend in Crown Heights to be exposed to the beauty of Torah observance and to &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; teachings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked very hard as a volunteer for &lt;em&gt;Pegisha&lt;/em&gt;, and I did learn the truth. I learned the importance of outreach, how crucial it was to save Jewish souls. And, perhaps in the merit of the effort I devoted to this task, I also recognized that my future husband was, in truth, a big &lt;em&gt;talmid chacham.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got engaged, the Rebbe gave us his blessing on the condition that my husband would initially learn Torah in a &lt;em&gt;kollel&lt;/em&gt; for married men. And so, after our wedding, we went to Israel for three years while my husband studied in a &lt;em&gt;kollel&lt;/em&gt; in Kfar Chabad and Nachlat Har Chabad. The Rebbe cared that I wanted a Torah scholar, and he made sure that I was completely satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rebbetzin Channah Hecht and her husband, Rabbi Sholem Ber Hecht, are the head Chabad emissaries in Queens, New York, where they have served the Sephardic community for the past fifty years. They are the proud parents of fourteen children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She was interviewed in December 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Knocking on the Gates of Trust</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/677.-Vayechi-5786-Email.pdf</link>

      <description>A student from Detroit shares her memories of &quot;falling in love&quot; with Yiddishkeit and moving to New York despite her parents' initial shock. She recounts her unique experiences as a newcomer and describes how the Rebbe’s guidance on &quot;bitachon&quot; (trust) helped her navigate doubts and find her soulmate.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I was born in “Motown,” as they used to call Detroit. Although my family was mildly Conservative, when we later moved to Oak Park, in the suburbs, I began attending the Chabad Hebrew school as it was close to our home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had wonderful, inspiring teachers there, like Rabbi Yankel Kranz, of blessed memory. They presented &lt;em&gt;Yiddishkeit&lt;/em&gt; to me as a set table, and I was invited to partake and to learn, without ever being told what to do. I fell in love with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Passover of 1969, while still in public school, I decided to make the leap and study in a Chabad girls’ school. As there wasn’t one in Detroit at the time, I wrote a letter to the Rebbe, sharing my thoughts and asking for a blessing to attend Bais Rivka, the central Chabad girls’ school in New York. I received the Rebbe’s blessing, but sadly, not that of my parents. They were shocked beyond belief. However, after receiving advice from various parties, they reluctantly gave permission for me to transfer schools, confident that I would return home once I “got it out of my system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Friday – public school, Sunday – fly to New York, and then Monday – Lubavitch girls’ high school. As I walked into a 10th-grade classroom, 25 pairs of eyes turned to look at the new kid on the block: Me, a girl who’d been Lubavitch for almost 24 hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I had encountered the truth, and by the time the school year ended, I was a full-fledged Lubavitcher girl, in every aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That summer saw me as a counselor in Camp Gan Israel in Michigan, after which my parents had expected me to be “over it.” For the next school year, they expected I would continue my education at home. But I was adamant. “I’m not going back to public school,” I declared. As I had never defied my parents before, they were totally bewildered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we compromised. For my junior year, I would join the local Orthodox high school, Bais Yaakov of Detroit. That was fine with me, and I gladly accepted my role as one of the few Lubavitch girls there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, with the permission of my parents, I happily returned to NY for my senior year, followed by seminary. Rabbi Kranz, G-d bless him, footed the tuition bill, in addition to paying for room, board, and transportation – for me, as well as for a few other Detroit girls who had come to study close to the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing my seminary studies, I stayed on in Crown Heights as a teacher in Bais Rivkah, and I began looking to get married. I was anxious to find my soulmate and together go out as Chabad emissaries. What could be greater than that? But although a number of eligible &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; students were suggested, none of them were the right fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to wonder what was going on. &lt;em&gt;Am I doing something wrong?&lt;/em&gt; Of course, I was keeping “cosmically busy,” as I called it – working as a dorm counselor, assisting in summer camps, creating floats for the Lag B’Omer parades – but it all felt like busy work, distracting me from what I really wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does a &lt;em&gt;chasid&lt;/em&gt; do at such a juncture? I put my heart’s desire as ink on parchment, and penned a letter to the Rebbe asking for a blessing to find my soulmate, and I placed it in my briefcase. At that time, I was renting a basement apartment from one of the Rebbe’s secretaries, Rabbi Binyomin Klein of blessed memory, so I was planning to hand him the letter to pass on to the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my way home from teaching that afternoon, about to cross the street near 770, I saw the Rebbe, in his car, stopped at a red light. Instead of looking ahead or down into a book, as he often did, the Rebbe was looking directly at me. I froze. I was holding my briefcase, with my letter in it, with one foot off the curb, ready to cross the street, but I didn’t budge. I couldn’t. A few moments passed, the light changed, and the Rebbe’s car continued on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Klein was driving, and he also noticed that something unusual had happened. “What was that?” he asked me when I saw him that evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My letter had been signed, sealed, and, for all practical purposes, I felt the content and the request it contained had already been delivered. All I had to do was hand in the physical letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Klein gave the letter to the Rebbe, and shortly thereafter, I received an answer. The Rebbe pointed me to &lt;em&gt;Shaar Habitachon &lt;/em&gt;(Gate of Trust), a section from the classic work of Jewish philosophy &lt;em&gt;Chovot Halevavot,&lt;/em&gt; about cultivating a sense of trust in G-d. The Rebbe suggested I study it “two or three times,” adding that “it can also be found in English.” That implied that I &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;needed to study this work and absorb it. The Rebbe wanted me to understand that G-d had not forgotten about me. I think he was telling me that there was someone out there for me to meet. I just had to be patient and believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to tell you I met my husband immediately after this, but that was not the case. When I finally met the young man who eventually became my husband, Tuvia was a tall, skinny, scholarly &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; student. I thought he was too quiet, too brainy, and too straight-laced for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, I wrote to the Rebbe about some of my nagging doubts. The Rebbe replied very clearly: “Speak with him directly, and hear what he has to say.” If I shared my concerns with this young man, we could discuss them together, and then I could make an informed decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That wasn’t so easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I shared with the Rebbe some things that are bothering me,” I began the next time we met. Tuvia invited me to share what was on my mind. But I was embarrassed to be so direct. We had met in a park that day, and for a few minutes, we walked up and down the path, in total silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s okay,” he eventually said. “I have patience.” I was impressed with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally shared what I had told the Rebbe, and listened to his response. I thanked him as he dropped me off at home, and then the ball was in my court. I thought about it and realized that my future husband didn’t need to be louder than I was in order for me to look up to him. He was everything I wanted, just in a quiet package. Thank goodness he had the patience to wait for me until I came around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank G-d, we’re now going on 50 years! The Rebbe urged me to keep my trust in G-d front and center, strong and present, and I’m still at it. It’s a lifelong process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mrs. Chaya Teldon co-founded Chabad of Long Island together with her husband, Rabbi Tuvia Teldon, in 1977. She has continued to serve in that role since, as well as lecturing around the world. She was interviewed in December 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It’s the Daughter from Baltimore!</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/676.-Vayigash-5786-Email.pdf</link>

      <description>Drawing on personal memories, a women reflects on her family’s transition to Lubavitch and her own meeting with the Rebbe at age thirteen. She recounts her firsthand experiences of his kind, inviting aura and his remarkable ability to remember &quot;the daughter from Baltimore&quot; months after their firs...</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;My parents, Berel and Miriam Weiss, both came from chasidic communities inCentral Europe. My mother came from a distinguished family of Vishnitz chasidim, while my father’s father was a chasid of the Kossoner Rebbe. Both lost most of their families in the Holocaust.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While recovering from the war, they met in a hospital. Together, they decided to move to Los Angeles, where my father had some family, and they got married there in 1948. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, my father became connected to Rabbi Shmuel Dovid Raichik, who had come to Los Angeles as a Chabad emissary in the late 1940s. As a result, when my father felt a need for spiritual guidance, he began to correspond with the Lubavitcher Rebbe, and in 1961, Rabbi Raichik convinced my father to make a trip to visit him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No sooner than when he saw the Rebbe, my father was enchanted. He just saw something special there – a purity, a simplicity – and he fell in love with the whole scene in 770. He connected with the Rebbe right away, and the Rebbe connected with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to understand that for a Hungarian, going over to Chabad was quite unusual. Hungarian and Romanian &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; groups, and even Polish ones, would interact with each other more, but the Russian &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; milieu remained somewhat apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also unusual was the Rebbe’s appearance. When my father came back from his first visit, he brought a small five-by-seven picture of the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where’s his &lt;em&gt;shtreimel&lt;/em&gt;?” I remember asking, referring to the traditional fur hat worn in &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This Rebbe doesn’t wear a &lt;em&gt;shtreimel&lt;/em&gt;,” he replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of our actual practice, not much changed at first. My father still didn’t grow a beard, we continued to use the same prayer book, and my father continued to sing the same songs at the Shabbat table that he had grown up with – but my parents had made a decision about the fundamental orientation of our family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up, my siblings and I went to a small &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; day school called Toras Emes, but in 1964, when I was entering high school, my mother wasn’t satisfied with the local options. Instead, she became interested in sending me to a high school in Switzerland that she knew about from before the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my mother wasn’t eager to send me so far away, she had a friend who sent her daughter there, and she thought that it would be a good place for me to get a proper Jewish education. But before that was decided, Rabbi Raichik advised my father to write to the Rebbe about the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That isn’t the school for your daughter,” the Rebbe replied, to my mother’s disappointment. “It’s gone through some changes, and it is no longer the school that it was.” She couldn’t understand how this Rebbe – who didn’t wear a &lt;em&gt;shtreimel&lt;/em&gt; or dress like any of the other Rebbes she was accustomed to – would know what was going on in a school in Switzerland, but with that answer, there was no way my father would agree to send me there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, as it happened, the man who ran the school became ill, and his son took over, which set off a quarrel between them about how the school should function. The police and the courts got involved, and it ended up being a horrible year for the school and its students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of Switzerland, a friend and mentor of my parents recommended the Beis Yaakov school in Baltimore. This time, when they wrote to the Rebbe, he agreed to the choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still only thirteen, so my mother first took me on a trip to visit Baltimore. New York was hosting the World’s Fair then, and since this was our first trip to the East Coast, my mother decided to take me there first. Of course, Rabbi Raichik saw this as an opportunity for my mother to make a visit to the Lubavitcher Rebbe, which she agreed to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a train into Brooklyn from Manhattan, where we were staying, which was very exciting because I had never been on a train before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Raichik had prepared my mother for the audience before we left California, and even wrote a letter for her to give to the Rebbe. “Mrs. Weiss, when you go into the Rebbe’s room, hand this letter to him,” he instructed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rabbi Raichik, I can’t do that!” my mother protested. Growing up, she had seen many Rebbes going through their home, and in the Hungarian &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; world she knew, these kinds of things were simply not done. A woman would not even go into a room with a Rebbe; maybe she would talk to him through the doorway. But Rabbi Raichik insisted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we went into the room and, trembling, she approached the Rebbe’s desk, gave him the letter&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and began to back away. The Rebbe gave us a big smile, welcomed us very graciously, and invited us to sit down. Chabad &lt;em&gt;chasidim &lt;/em&gt;don’t sit down in front of their Rebbe, but we weren’t really &lt;em&gt;chasidim &lt;/em&gt;yet, so we did, and soon the Rebbe started talking to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to see that the Rebbe looked older than in my father’s picture, but his eyes were so kind, and he made me feel very comfortable. He had an aura about him, although it wasn’t something that intimidated you; it was an aura that drew you in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe began to ask me questions: “What do you like to do in school? What do you like to read?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told the Rebbe that I was reading &lt;em&gt;Oliver Twist&lt;/em&gt;, the classic Charles Dickens novel. I had also started to read &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Tale of Two Cities&lt;/em&gt;. So we had a discussion about &lt;em&gt;Oliver Twist, &lt;/em&gt;and we even spoke about the scene where Oliver, a hungry orphan living in 19th-century London, holds out his bowl to beg the head of his orphanage for a second helping of gruel. “How did you feel about that?” the Rebbe wanted to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is happening? &lt;/em&gt;I thought to myself. This was not what I had expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you a good student?” the Rebbe inquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes,” I answered. “I’m not always the best student.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe smiled at this. “I hope you’ll do well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe seemed concerned about me going away from home at a young age, and asked if I was comfortable with the idea. He was very grandfatherly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think I’ll be OK,” I said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe gave me a blessing to do well in school and to settle into Baltimore, and he said that he hoped to see me again soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we left the room, my mother and I were so emotional that we both burst into tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months later, once the school year had started, my father came back to Crown Heights for Simchat Torah. We arranged that I would meet my father in 770 on Hoshana Rabbah, when the Rebbe would be giving out honey cake in his Sukkah. My father insisted that I stand together with him in line, which made me feel out of place since I was old enough to be in the women’s line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we came up to the Rebbe, he gave me a huge smile. “Ah!” he said, “It’s the daughter from Baltimore!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mrs. Chanie Levitin has served as a Chabad emissary in Seattle, Washington, since 1972. She was interviewed in February 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 1977, I had been working at the Lubavitch Youth Organization, which oversees Chabad’s outreach work in the New York area, for a little over ten years. By then, a handful of cities around America had started to have public Chanukah menorah lightings, and we figured that New York deserved to have one too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that Chanukah, Mayor Abraham Beame gave us permission to put up a public menorah on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People soon complained: “If the Lubavitchers want to put up a menorah, let them do it on Eastern Parkway!” But as Mayor Beame joked, since neither of us is very tall, “Rabbi Butman and I saw eye-to-eye.” He was such a warm Jew that he even came to light the menorah himself. One night that first year, after the lighting, the Rebbe’s wife, Rebbetzin Chaya Mushka, came to see the menorah for herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, every mayor of New York City has helped light the menorah, along with many governors, senators, and other dignitaries. If the mayor was Jewish, they would light the whole menorah, and if not, they would light the &lt;em&gt;shamash&lt;/em&gt;, the central flame from which the rest of the menorah is lit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, when people protested the participation of government officials at these religious ceremonies, the Rebbe pointed to state Attorney General Robert Abrams’ presence at the lighting: If the attorney general, who is the custodian of law and order in New York, himself lit the menorah, then he clearly believes that it isn’t a legal issue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in general, the Rebbe stayed away from politics, and the Rebbe’s secretary, Rabbi Hodakov told us to be careful not to invite politicians who don’t hold office. As he explained, “If you invite someone who holds office, you’re honoring the position, not the individual.” However, if you honor a person who is &lt;em&gt;running&lt;/em&gt; for mayor or city comptroller, you can’t say you’re honoring the office, because they don’t have an office. Instead, you are honoring the politician, and you are taking sides by associating with them rather than their opponent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, it wasn’t always easy to stay away from politicians while they were campaigning because I knew some of them personally, and sometimes they would ask to appear at the lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year, the Parks Commissioner – who was not too friendly to Jews, to say the least – called up the then-mayor Ed Koch. “Why do they need Fifth Avenue every year?” he complained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Koch agreed to support his commissioner to have us moved, we began planning to launch a campaign against the mayor. We would go to the press, and argue that if non-Jews celebrating their festivities could stay, then the Jews shouldn’t have to wander about from place to place – but first we asked the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t you know,” answered the Rebbe, “that one doesn’t go to war with Koch?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, the only thing left for us to do was to meet with the Parks Commissioner, and so I went to his office together with Rabbi Dovid Raskin, and after a long conversation, he conceded that we could return: “But for one year, you gotta leave.” Instead of Fifth Avenue, he gave us a spot nearby on 59th Street for that year. The next year, he was fired, and we returned to our original spot. As a result of the Rebbe’s advice, we continued to get on quite well with Mayor Koch. He could be very helpful and cooperative on some issues, but once he had already made a decision, you couldn’t move him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime after that, when Chabad in S. Louis, Missouri, was promoting its public menorah lighting, there was strong opposition from the local Jewish community leadership, and the Federation there wound up divided on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, Ed Koch came to speak for the S. Louis United Jewish Appeal, and during the question-and-answer period, a woman asked him to weigh in on the controversy: “As you know, Mr. Mayor, some of us are not happy with allowing a public menorah lighting to take place,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s wrong with a public lighting?” asked Koch, to applause from the crowd. “In my city, we have the world’s largest menorah, and I lit it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, we spoke to Yaakov Agam, who is one of the most famous living Jewish artists today, about making his own design of the menorah. After working on it for some time, he sent a miniature model of his menorah, which at full scale would be the largest in the world. “Can this work?” he wanted to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in a sense, the Rebbe revolutionized the modern look of the menorah. Before the 1980s, the branches of any menorah would almost always be half-round. The Rebbe was the one who pointed out that in Maimonides’ depiction of the menorah that stood in the Temple, which can be found in his Halachic work &lt;em&gt;Mishneh Torah&lt;/em&gt;, the branches are actually straight. In addition, the biblical commentary Rashi also held that the branches of the menorah were “&lt;em&gt;b’alachson,&lt;/em&gt;” which means that they extended out in a slanted line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yaakov Agam’s menorah looked very nice, and the branches were slanted, but it didn’t look exactly like the temple menorah, which had a distinct middle branch, so we weren’t sure if it would work. We sent the model to the Rebbe, and after it sat on the Rebbe’s desk for three days, we received a reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to give him a chance to make his own interpretation of the menorah,” said the Rebbe. After all, if we just had a menorah the way it was in the temple, then where would we see Agam’s artistic design? This way, we were able to have a menorah inspired by Maimonides’ description, as well as by Yaakov Agam’s personal touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, when Agam came to meet the Rebbe one Sunday, as he was distributing dollars for charity, the Rebbe thanked him personally for the design. Whenever Agam is in New York for Chanukah, he is proud to come and light his menorah, and in other years, his son lights it in his place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The menorah became a real attraction. One year, a certain Jew from Chicago was visiting New York and convinced his family to come along to see the world’s largest menorah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, the last day of the holiday was on Wednesday. We had done a public lighting on Tuesday evening and then – because the Rebbe had once told us to light the menorah in the morning, as well – lit it again at 7:00 AM. But later that morning, by mistake, the crane we had contracted to come to take the menorah down on Thursday came a day early. So, when this family headed out from their hotel that afternoon to go to Fifth Avenue, lo and behold, there was no menorah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This man had promised his wife that they would see the world’s largest menorah, and now he had egg on his face. Feeling frustrated, he went back to his hotel and fired off a letter to the Rebbe: “Dear Rabbi Schneerson, I came to see your menorah, but it was not there!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe then sent out this letter to us, along with a big question mark. So we wrote this man a very nice letter – as well as a copy to the Rebbe, which he approved – thanking him for bringing this mistake to our attention and committing, in the future, that the menorah would stay up for the entire Chanukah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Shmuel Butman was the longtime director of the Lubavitch Youth Organization in New York until his passing in July of 2024. He was interviewed in December 2011 and January 2012.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Hallway was His Classroom</title>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a boy back in Russia, my father, Rabbi Yisroel Meir Munitz, would study Torah very diligently, and every Thursday night – even before his Bar Mitzvah – he would study all night. One Thursday, he had a headache and couldn’t concentrate, so he decided to go home from the study hall. It was a cold winter night, and on his way home, he heard singing; he was passing by a gathering of &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; celebrating the Chabad holiday of &lt;em&gt;Yud-Tes Kislev&lt;/em&gt;. He decided to go inside, and as he would often say, once he entered, he never left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He became a real &lt;em&gt;chasid&lt;/em&gt;, studying Chabad teachings, and praying at great length, and he even taught Torah to children when it was against Soviet law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, after a close call with the KGB while teaching Torah, he and his friends resolved to one day open a &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; of their own. And in the 1950s, once they were living in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, they did. Oholei Torah, as it was called, started off in the home of one of those friends, Reb Elya Chaim Roitblat, who taught alongside my father, while the other friend, Reb Michoel Teitelbaum, took care of the administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born a little before this, though, in 1951. We were still living in the Lower East Side, but for the &lt;em&gt;brit&lt;/em&gt;, my father wanted to bring me to Crown Heights. That way, the Rebbe – who had only recently assumed the position – could serve in the honorary role of &lt;em&gt;sandek&lt;/em&gt;, by holding me during the ceremony. My father wanted to name me after the Previous Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, as well as after a relative whose name was Yosef. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt; just before the &lt;em&gt;brit&lt;/em&gt;, my father asked the Rebbe whether it is proper to also have this relative in mind while giving me the Previous Rebbe’s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe replied that “the name of a &lt;em&gt;tzaddik&lt;/em&gt;,” meaning a truly saintly figure like the Previous Rebbe, “should not be mixed with those of other people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, it emerged that this long-lost relative was actually alive – which was another reason, according to our tradition, not to name me after him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the day of the &lt;em&gt;brit&lt;/em&gt;, my mother still wasn’t feeling well and couldn’t travel to Crown Heights, so it took place in the Lower East Side, and the Rebbe sent three &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; students to represent him at the event. As they were emerging from the subway on their way back, they saw the Rebbe coming out of 770.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you coming from the &lt;em&gt;brit&lt;/em&gt;?” the Rebbe inquired. “What is the name?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yosef Yitzchok,” they replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The name of a &lt;em&gt;tzaddik&lt;/em&gt;,” remarked the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we moved to Crown Heights, we lived in an apartment on New York Avenue – just down the road from where the Rebbe and his wife lived at the time. As children, we tried to figure out the time that the Rebbe would be walking to 770 in the morning, and we would wave to him as he walked by. The Rebbe would make sure to look up at us and wave back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before my Bar Mitzvah, I had a special audience with the Rebbe, along with my father, and after that, I would have an audience with the Rebbe each year on my birthday. The custom was that you would write a note with anything you wanted to say, and when you came to the Rebbe, he would read it, and, almost at the same time, respond to everything you had written. One year, while reading in my note that I was turning 17, he took a pen, circled my age, and wrote “&lt;em&gt;tov&lt;/em&gt;.” That is to say, the Hebrew word for “good” has the numerical value of 17. As he gave me a blessing for the year ahead, with a small smile, he picked up the paper and showed me what he had written. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my father started to get too old to keep teaching in Oholei Torah, the school was planning to suggest that he retire. But when they wrote to the Rebbe about it, he replied that it would be worth keeping my father there, if only for the students to see his face in the hallway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, my father was given the responsibility of sitting in the school hallway – and any kids who were misbehaving in class would go out and spend time with him. I later heard from many Oholei Torah students that they would try to get sent out of class so that they could study together with my father – especially when they had a test coming up! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late ‘70s, I moved to Pittsburgh to serve as a Chabad emissary under the direction of Rabbi Sholom Posner, who founded the local Chabad &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt;. It was just after my father had passed away, and he took me in like his own son. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, we moved into a house that had belonged to one of the teachers in the local school and was being sold. It was barely livable; there were broken windows and doors, and the heat didn’t work. It was so freezing in the winter that we had to move out, but the search for a replacement was difficult. When we did find something that we could afford, I didn’t know if it would be large enough for our family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wrote a letter about the apartment to the Rebbe, to which he replied: “As is well known – it is preferable to buy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could barely afford the rent, and now the Rebbe was telling me to buy a home! When I got the reply, I ran straight to Rabbi Posner. “How could I possibly do this?!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Rebbe said to buy a house,” Rabbi Posner replied. “So find a house that is for sale, and you will buy it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I found one, the price was exorbitant – there was no way I could afford it – and so I went back to Rabbi Posner. That’s when he told me, “I’ve bought much larger properties without any money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Posner knew some of the members of the local Federation who might be open to supporting a community educator, and he advised me to approach them. “But if you ask for a thousand dollars, they’ll only give a hundred. Ask for ten thousand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that was too much, so I only asked the Federation for seven – and they gave me all seven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You should have asked for twenty-five!” Rabbi Posner chided me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, a free loan society in Crown Heights gave me enough money to cover the rest, and the Jewish owners of the house agreed to let me rent the house until I had done so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, as impossible as it had seemed when the Rebbe first raised the idea, we ended up buying the house and living there for nineteen years, until we moved to open the Mesivta Menachem &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; in Buffalo, New York. Along the way, Rabbi Posner taught me a lesson: When the Rebbe tells you to do something, you do it! You’re worried about material considerations? You don’t have enough money? Worry about those things later – G-d will help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Munitz is a &lt;/em&gt;mashpia&lt;em&gt; (&lt;/em&gt;chasidic &lt;em&gt;mentor&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;in the local community and a part-time teacher in the Ohr Temimim &lt;/em&gt;yeshivah&lt;em&gt; of Buffalo. He was interviewed in June 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In the Unforeseeable Future</title>

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Before his passing in 1971, my father, Leon Schottenstein and his brothers had built a successful retail and real-estate enterprise in our hometown of Columbus, Ohio. About ten years later, our branch of the family left the retail business to focus solely on real estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time, I had gotten introduced to the Chabad movement through my sister and her husband, Chaya and Daniel Wuensch. As a family, we had helped fund the Landow Yeshivah day school, which was run by Chabad in Miami Beach, in memory of our father. Two years later, in 1984, after our family made another substantial donation to Chabad, my sister and her husband were invited to an event of the Machne Israel Development Fund, and the following year, my brother Tuvia and I were invited too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machne Israel was a philanthropic organization founded by the Rebbe to advance Chabad's work, and twice each year members of this group were granted a private audience with the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were honored and excited, though unsure of what awaited us, having never participated in such an event before. I was deeply moved by the experience, though I was so nervous that my memories of that first Machne Israel gathering remain vivid only in feeling, not in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can clearly remember from that first encounter was the Rebbe’s remarkably gentle manner and his extraordinary eyes. People had told me, “Once you see his eyes, you'll never forget them.” That turned out to be an understatement. Decades later, I can still recall how striking and penetrating his blue eyes were, even as his gaze was profoundly kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the years passed, I became increasingly comfortable at the Machne Israel gatherings. They offered a wonderful opportunity not only to interact with the Rebbe, but also to request a blessing or seek his advice. The attendees themselves were an engaging and fascinating group of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother and sister frequently shared stories they had heard about people’s encounters with the Rebbe, about advice he had given and the remarkable results that followed. I tended to view these accounts as being somewhat apocryphal, or at least embellished. That skepticism never diminished my admiration for the Rebbe nor my respect for Chabad, but I found it difficult to believe that these events had unfolded exactly as described.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Unexpectedly, after attending these Machne Israel events for three or four years, I experienced a story of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, our family business was preparing a major redevelopment of a prominent property in downtown Columbus — a high-rise building on a corner overlooking the Ohio Statehouse. Built in the 1920s, the building was more than sixty years old and had a terra-cotta facade. Terra-cotta requires regular maintenance, and unfortunately, this building had been neglected for decades. By the time we acquired the property, the facade had deteriorated so severely that pieces were detaching from the structure, and we had to place netting around the upper portion of the building to prevent debris from falling. Its condition was so poor that the city was considering condemning and demolishing it – a scenario that would have been disastrous for our redevelopment plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compounding this challenge was the fact that the country was in the midst of a recession. During boom times, one might feel confident undertaking such a project, but in a recession – with little pre-leasing and no certainty of tenants – this redevelopment carried significant risk. Because of these difficulties, my brother urged me to seek a blessing from the Rebbe. Initially, I resisted. I believed we shouldn't trouble the Rebbe with business matters when people were seeking blessings for far more critical issues, like their health. Why impose upon him for something as mundane as a commercial venture? But my brother persisted, and eventually I agreed to ask at the next Machne Israel event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approached the Rebbe during our one-on-one meeting – as was the protocol at these events – I said: “We are working on a major project in downtown Columbus, and we would appreciate receiving a blessing for it to succeed.”&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The Rebbe gave his blessing, but then he suggested that we make additional plans for the project to be larger. He explained that if we expand our plans, G-d will increase his blessings, and we will be successful beyond our expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made absolutely no sense to me. We were already using the entire parcel of land and expanding the building to the limits set by the structural engineer. The project was fixed; there was nothing else that could conceivably be added. I even told our local Chabad rabbi afterward that I didn't understand what the Rebbe could have meant.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Ultimately, we managed to avoid the building being condemned, and thank G-d, the redevelopment was extremely successful. Despite completing the project in the depths of the 1991 recession and opening with only 20% of the building leased, we reached 100% occupancy within eight months – something virtually unheard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, one of our anchor tenants was a major regional bank that had leased approximately 20,000 square feet, with an option to expand by up to an additional 15,000 square feet. It had signed a 25-year lease, but after only two years it had grown so rapidly that even this was not enough. The bank informed us that unless it could secure additional space, it would have to relocate. This was alarming. The bank was a tonal tenant whose presence helped define the building and establish it as a “Class A” property on the commercial real estate market. The bank had to continue paying out its lease, but if its place was left empty, or even it managed to sublet it to someone else, the entire building would be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately to the west of our site was a parcel owned by the Taubman Company, originally intended to serve as part of a mall development contiguous to the south of our site. Taubman had repeatedly stated that it would use this parcel as a connector to the site of the Ohio State Capitol building, so we had never considered it acquirable. Then, in a completely unexpected turn of events, Taubman abandoned their plan, and we were able to purchase the parcel.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
This utterly unforeseeable development allowed us to build a massive addition to our structure. With 23 stories, over 300,000 square feet, and a large parking facility, the expansion was more than twice the size of the original building. The two properties became a single integrated project, giving the bank exactly the space it needed to stay and continue its extraordinary growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this could have been predicted. When the Rebbe told us to expand the project, there was absolutely no indication that such a possibility even existed. Yet, with hindsight, everything aligned in a way that made his words not only sensible, but remarkably prescient. We ultimately sold the entire complex in 2006, and it became one of the most successful real-estate ventures ever completed in the city of Columbus. For years, I dismissed such stories as being apocryphal… but not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My parents, Eliezer Gershon and Menucha Lazaroff, were both from Russia, where their fathers had both been Lubavitcher rabbis, but I was born in Georgia. It was in the middle of the Second World War, and conditions there were better for Jews than in other parts of the Soviet Union. When I was just six months old and my mother was expecting her second child, my father was taken away to join the army. Unfortunately, he never came back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the war was over, and my courageous mother learned my father’s fate, we managed to get permission to leave the Soviet Union. After wandering through Europe with a group of Lubavitcher refugees, we made it to Paris, where we remained for three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there we joined a group of Lubavitchers who moved to Israel. We settled in the town of Lod, and then moved to Jerusalem in around 1952, when I was ten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time, the Previous Rebbe had passed away and was succeeded by his son-in-law. It is interesting how we felt a connection to the new Rebbe right away. Even though my mother knew him from a visit he made to Paris in 1947, I had never seen him at all. There were no videos in those days, and very few pictures, yet we knew that there was some type of tie between us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother would write to the Rebbe all the time. One thing she asked him a few times was about moving to the United States. Things were hard for her in Israel, and her brothers who were already living in North America thought that it would be easier for her to make a living there. For a time, the Rebbe advised her to not come, explaining that the education was better in Israel. Only in 1958 did he tell her that it was okay to come – perhaps because my brother and I were already older, and the Jewish community in America was more established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, from age ten to sixteen, I grew up in Jerusalem, attending the Beis Yaakov girls’ school. Now, shortly after the Rebbe had assumed his leadership in 1950, he began encouraging his &lt;em&gt;chasidim &lt;/em&gt;to spread Judaism to those who were less observant. In those days, many religious Jews objected to this. &lt;em&gt;How can you mingle with people who do not observe the Torah? &lt;/em&gt;they wondered. &lt;em&gt;If you send young people out of the community, you are putting them at risk! &lt;/em&gt;Eventually they saw what this kind of work accomplished and they started to do many of the same things, but back then the Rebbe came under a lot of criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 1950s in Israel, there were large numbers of Jewish immigrants arriving into the country, being placed in absorption centers and transit camps, called &lt;em&gt;ma’abarot. &lt;/em&gt;Most of them were not coming from Europe like we had, but were fleeing from Morocco, Yemen, and other Arab countries. Although their Jewish identity and faith tended to be strong, and they were far from secular, these immigrants often had very little knowledge about Judaism. My friend Rochel Sasonkin – today Rochel Dunin of Taanach, Israel – and I were the only Lubavitchers in our school, and so when we heard about it, we decided to take up this new mandate from the Rebbe. We would go to the &lt;em&gt;ma’abarot, &lt;/em&gt;organize programs for the children there, and share whatever we young girls knew about Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we felt that we had this responsibility towards others, we weren’t always sure how to best go about our activities. So, in 1955, I wrote a letter to the Rebbe asking him for guidance on exactly what we should do in these &lt;em&gt;ma’abarot&lt;/em&gt;, and how to go about it in the most effective way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, we received a reply by airmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m surprised by the question,” began the Rebbe. “Just as you can be sure that you are influenced by your friends, and just as every person is influenced by their surroundings… how much more so here: Any effort on behalf of Torah and &lt;em&gt;mitzvot&lt;/em&gt;… has the power to penetrate and to resonate many times over…” In other words, just as many of my friends and classmates had been a positive influence on me, the Rebbe expected me to fill that role and be a positive influence in matters of Judaism for others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then he gave “two general points regarding such efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, that I myself should serve as a “living example, in your conduct and your affairs, of what the daughter of &lt;em&gt;chasidic &lt;/em&gt;home” is supposed to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, he recommended that I share “&lt;em&gt;chasidic &lt;/em&gt;stories and ideas in the appropriate language, and in a way they can understand. For this, rich and diverse content can be found in the talks [of the Previous Rebbe] and in his Likkutei Dibburim.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So long as your words come from the heart,” the Rebbe added, “if you speak of these matters again and again, you can be certain that your words will be accepted and have an impact.” He then concluded by telling me to consult with the leaders of the Chabad women’s group in Jerusalem, who would be able to give us practical guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day during this period, my teacher at Beis Yaakov told me to ask my mother to come in for a meeting with her. Thank G-d, I wasn’t a troublemaker, but I didn’t know what it was about and, out of worry, I could barely sleep that night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I heard that your daughter and her friend are involved with Chabad,” the teacher told my mother the next day. “They have been going to different places with non-observant children, and we are very concerned. She is getting a Torah education at Beis Yaakov, but we are worried that the environment there may affect her negatively. Did you know that she is doing this?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother, who was herself the head of the local Chabad women’s group, explained that she knew exactly what I had been doing. “Believe me, if I saw that this was having a negative influence on my daughter, I would not let her go. But actually, I have seen that the effects are very positive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That letter from the Rebbe has guided me for the rest of my life, but decades later, after it was published (in Igrot Kodesh Volume 12) I noticed something about it. The date on the letter was the 7th of Tishrei – meaning that it was written just a few days before Yom Kippur. Normally, the Rebbe would only answer the most urgent letters during this period, known as the Ten Days of Repentance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It amazes me that, during a time he usually did not respond to such letters at all, the Rebbe not only paid attention to a letter from a fourteen-year-old girl in Jerusalem who had asked him a question, but decided to reply immediately. He also could have just told us to consult with the local Chabad women and left it at that, but he took the time to offer guidance and some detailed instructions. It seems that, for the Rebbe, this really &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;a matter of spiritual urgency: On a question like this, about the souls of Jewish children, there was to be no delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mrs. Batsheva Shemtov has served as the Chabad emissary to Philadelphia, together with her husband Rabbi Avrohom Shemtov, since 1962. She was interviewed in May 2015 and January 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>At about age 40, I had a religious awakening and I began – together with my wife Shaindel – to become Torah observant.

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At about age 40, I had a religious awakening and I began – together with my wife Shaindel – to become Torah observant. Back then – this was in the early 1980s – I was in private practice as an ophthalmologist in Flint, Michigan, which is where I was born and raised. Life was good, but both my wife and I realized that if we wanted our two children to identify as Jews, we had to make Judaism part of our lives. We started attending a local Conservative synagogue and keeping kosher. But it was not until I chanced upon Chabad Lubavitch that we both began learning Torah and following Jewish law seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happened when my father – who unbeknownst to me had supported Chabad causes – became ill and Rabbi Berel Shemtov, the Chabad emissary in Detroit, came to visit him in the hospital. I saw how Rabbi Shemtov interacted with my father and I took an instant liking to him. One thing led to another, and Rabbi Shemtov dispatched Rabbi Yitschak Meir Kagan to learn Torah with me once a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our study sessions, Rabbi Kagan never spoke about the Rebbe or Chabad activities, but one day in 1986, he asked if I would attend a meeting in New York of the recently-founded Machne Israel Development Fund – the group which raised money for Chabad institutions and projects. To be honest, I had no interest in this at all but, out of respect for Rabbi Kagan, I agreed to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group that came to this meeting was comprised of the fund’s financial supporters. We had a meeting in 770, and then we were each granted an audience with the Rebbe. Now, I had no idea who the Rebbe was. I was not even familiar with the title “Rebbe.” It sounded similar to Rabbi or Rabbanan, so I figured this must be the leader of Lubavitch &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will never forget the moment I saw him. I was standing in the lobby of 770 near the &lt;em&gt;tzedakah&lt;/em&gt; box, when he walked in and the entire room fell silent. He passed inches away from me to put a nickel – I vividly recall it was a buffalo nickel – in the box, without looking around the room, which was filled with high-powered donors. He was totally focused on the act of giving charity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in that moment, I instantly knew why he was the Rebbe. He had uncommon presence. Just seeing him was enough to know that this was a man of stature. The only way I can describe it is that there was greatness about him. And everything he did was a teaching moment. On another occasion, he explained why he was giving &lt;em&gt;tzedakah &lt;/em&gt;upon entering the synagogue. He said that it’s always good to start the day with giving to charity because this &lt;em&gt;mitzvah &lt;/em&gt;brings goodness and holiness to what follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the prayer service, we each met with the Rebbe individually. I was very nervous and have almost no recollection of what he said to me at the time, but I do recall one key thing – that he interrupted himself in the middle of a sentence and the meeting was suddenly over. I had a sense that something unusual had happened but I did not know what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine my surprise, therefore, when six months later, I again attended the fund’s meeting and the Rebbe picked up in the middle of the very sentence that he interrupted the time before. And then I also remembered what he said before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His message was that “a Jew has it in his power to change his community.” Rabbi Kagan was present and heard him, and he got very excited. “Did you hear what the Rebbe said?” he asked me afterwards. I answered vaguely that I heard the Rebbe speak about Jewish people doing good things. “No, he was speaking to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;! You have the power to change &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That led me to ask myself: What can I do? And I realized that I couldn’t do very much on my own and that I needed to recruit others for this cause. As a result, my wife and I brought Rabbi Yisroel and Rebbetzin Shainie Weingarten to Flint. At first, our initiatives faced some opposition but, little by little, the community was changed – as the Rebbe predicted it would be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establishing a Jewish day school was particularly important because the Rebbe stressed the role that education plays in furthering Judaism – that it is crucial to have as much education as possible. And we certainly took his instructions to heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the time that the Rebbe gave the directive, “a Jew has it in his power to change his community,” we were committed one hundred percent. Anything that had to be done to make the school successful, we did. Together with the Weingartens, we got other people in the community involved, and we gave out scholarships to all of the kids whose parents lacked the financial means to pay the tuition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the school, we worked with the Weingartens to establish a synagogue and built the first &lt;em&gt;mikveh&lt;/em&gt; the city ever had. We offered Torah classes tailored to adults, and we created special programs for Russian Jews of whom many had settled in Flint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is how – following the Rebbe’s vision for us – our community was changed, and not only our community but, eventually, the lives of all the Jews living in Flint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that entire experience, I learned that when the Rebbe gives you an instruction, you can be assured that you are going to be successful. And I also learned another thing – that as long as one follows the Torah, blessings are just about guaranteed. The Rebbe himself wrote to me about this when I asked for his blessing for the school. He answered that he didn’t have to give a blessing because G-d told Abraham, “I will bless those who bless you … and through you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe pointed out that we were in the category of those who are carrying on Abraham’s work, so we would be sure to be blessed by G-d.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we were blessed and, along with us, our entire community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It was Shabbat, in the summer of 1991, and I was a student in the &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; at 770 Eastern Parkway. My close friend, Rabbi Zalman Notik, was getting married that week, and so we were also celebrating his “&lt;em&gt;aufruf&lt;/em&gt;,” when the groom is called up for the reading of the Torah – the portion of &lt;em&gt;Naso&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 1:30 PM, the Rebbe held a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt; – as he did every Shabbat in those years – after which we went to celebrate with the groom in a home in Crown Heights. It was around 8:00 that evening when suddenly someone burst in shouting, “&lt;em&gt;Farbrengen!&lt;/em&gt;” – the Rebbe is holding a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;, unscheduled, and so late in the day!? Most of us thought it was a prank. But I decided not to take any chances. I ran toward 770, and as I got closer, I saw others teeming hurriedly in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scene that greeted me when I entered 770 was like no &lt;em&gt;farbrengen &lt;/em&gt;I had seen before. The Rebbe was sitting at the edge of the platform at the front of the synagogue, where he normally prayed, speaking to a few dozen &lt;em&gt;chasidim &lt;/em&gt;clustered around him. Usually at &lt;em&gt;farbrengens&lt;/em&gt; the Rebbe sat behind a long table to the side of the room, set off from the crowd, with the elder &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; positioned closest to him. Now, there was no table at all – just the Rebbe on a chair, encircled mostly by &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I later learned that only minutes before sunset, the Rebbe had suddenly walked into the synagogue from his room upstairs, holding his prayer book in one hand and a cup of water and towel in the other. The Rebbe washed his hands, made the blessing for bread, and – once the few people who happened to be in the room at the time recovered from their shock – the &lt;em&gt;farbrengen &lt;/em&gt;began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I had weaved my way towards the front, the Rebbe was finishing the first of three talks. He then asked that we sing the &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; melodies associated with each of the Rebbes of Chabad, starting with the &lt;em&gt;Three Stanzas, &lt;/em&gt;composed by the Baal Shem Tov, the Maggid of Mezritch, and the Alter Rebbe. “Through this,” he said, “we will leave the Exile!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe’s words had an electrifying effect, and the atmosphere soared with emotion and excitement – everyone felt something extraordinary was happening. The Rebbe strongly encouraged the singing, but for the most part his face was serious and there was a certain intensity to his demeanor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second talk, the Rebbe noted that according to the mystics, Shabbat afternoon is when the full “divine delight” of the holy day is revealed. He went on to speak about serving G-d with joy and pleasure, especially through Torah study. This message, he emphasized, was particularly directed at the &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; students – who made up most of the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As news spread of the surprise &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;, people poured in. We could feel it in the pressing of the crowd, which soon had the capacious room filled to overflowing. A little after 10:00 PM, the Rebbe announced that it was time to conclude. Then, after the &lt;em&gt;Havdalah &lt;/em&gt;service, he stayed to distribute wine from his cup. This was known as &lt;em&gt;Kos Shel Bracha, &lt;/em&gt;and typically it would only take place at the conclusion of festivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only after midnight did the distribution end. The &lt;em&gt;chasidim &lt;/em&gt;then carried with a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen &lt;/em&gt;of their own, singing and dancing deep into the night, exulting in this otherworldly experience they had just witnessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happened, I had personally witnessed a vivid example of the “delight in Torah” that the Rebbe urged during that &lt;em&gt;farbrengen &lt;/em&gt;earlier that week – on the evening following the holiday of Shavuot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire preceding week leading up to Shavuot had been relentlessly demanding for the Rebbe, starting with the preceding Sunday, when the Rebbe stood for over six hours distributing dollars for thousands of people to give to charity. Less than an hour later, he came down to the main synagogue to deliver an hour-long address to the international convention of the Lubavitch Women’s Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, Monday, he went to visit the resting place of the Previous Rebbe. On such days the Rebbe would not eat; he stood there in prayer for hours, and upon returning – after the evening service – he again stood distributing dollars to those present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe also went to the Previous Rebbe’s resting place and repeated that exhausting schedule on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. On Friday, he returned to 770 barely fifteen minutes before Shabbat candle-lighting. Two of the Rebbe’s Torah publications came out in that same time period – a scholarly discussion about the laws of the Counting of the Omer and a profound &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; discourse on Shavuot. Both had been personally edited by the Rebbe, which meant reviewing and correcting every line by hand, while making notes and additions. I remember wondering: &lt;em&gt;How does the Rebbe find the time for all this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came Shabbat, with the usual &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt; filled with deep Torah talks and spirited singing, immediately followed by the first night of Shavuot, when the Rebbe remained awake the entire night to read the traditional &lt;em&gt;Tikkun&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the second evening of the holiday, &lt;em&gt;chasidim &lt;/em&gt;would go out to visit communities and synagogues across New York, to bring joy and words of Torah. Once everybody returned to 770, close to midnight, the Rebbe came out to greet them and deliver another talk. A reference he made to some individuals “who recite the &lt;em&gt;Tikkun &lt;/em&gt;on both nights of Shavuot” suggested that the Rebbe may have been staying awake to study Torah for a second consecutive night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day brought yet another &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;, lasting until nightfall, and then thousands of people passing before the Rebbe, who stood and distributed wine to all of them. It was already after 2:00 AM when &lt;em&gt;Kos Shel Bracha&lt;/em&gt; ended, and the Rebbe – then eighty-nine years old – left the hall briskly and went up to his room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, young students of nineteen and twenty, were completely exhausted; after the all-night learning, the visits to those communities, and hours of standing during the &lt;em&gt;farbrengens&lt;/em&gt;, we just wanted to sleep. But first, I stepped outside for some air. Standing outside 770, opposite the Rebbe’s room, I noticed something odd: The curtain that covered his window was slightly drawn aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all my four years studying at 770, I had never seen the curtain moved. The windows themselves were frosted, but just translucent enough to see through. I couldn’t resist – I looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mere moments had passed since the Rebbe entered his room, yet there he was, seated at his desk, still wearing his &lt;em&gt;kapota&lt;/em&gt; and hat, leaning over a large open volume – possibly the Talmud or the &lt;em&gt;Tur &lt;/em&gt;Code of Jewish Law – completely immersed in learning. After ten relentless days, after six hours of &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Kos Shel Bracha&lt;/em&gt;, the Rebbe had not paused for even a sip of tea or a moment’s rest. He went straight to his Torah books, as if pouncing at the opportunity to study them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes, someone entered the room and closed the curtain. I suddenly felt a little guilty, as though I’d intruded on something private. But the sight was seared into my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a brief moment, I had peered into the Rebbe’s inner world. The Rebbe often spoke about studying Torah with passion and inner joy – and now I had seen it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dean of the Chabad &lt;/em&gt;yeshivah &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Netanya and rabbi of the local Yeshurun synagogue, Rabbi Moshe Orenstein had also authored several collections of stories about the Rebbe. He was interviewed in May 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A Holocaust survivor founded a rabbinical journal that united leading rabbis from across the Jewish world - with the Rebbe as his closest supporter for three decades. Whether helping fund a crucial building project or opening up during a time of profound personal loss, their relationship went far...</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My father, Rabbi Meir Amsel, was born in Neudorf, Slovakia. As a young boy, his mother would wake him up at 4:00 AM, tie a lantern to his chest, and send him to study Torah in the rundown local synagogue, where there was one teacher for all seven boys of the village. As a result of World War I, the family fled to nearby Košice, where under the guidance of the city’s leading rabbis, he pursued his deep passion for studying Torah. We, as children, never saw him without a Torah book in hand – he went to sleep with a volume of Talmud and woke up with it – and he had vast knowledge in all areas of Torah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After World War II, my father came to America and started a monthly rabbinical journal called &lt;em&gt;Hamaor&lt;/em&gt;. He had a sharp pen, a tremendous command of the Hebrew language, and a firm grasp on current affairs, especially those pertaining to the Jewish world. Dedicated to Torah discourse and the practical application of Jewish law, each issue of &lt;em&gt;Hamaor&lt;/em&gt; discussed issues in the Jewish religious arena that needed attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of all this, he developed close relationships with many of the great rabbinic figures in America, from the Lubavitcher Rebbe to Rabbi Eliezer Silver, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, Rabbi J. B. Soloveitchik, Rabbi Aharon Kotler, as well as the Satmar Rebbe, the Bobover Rebbe, and the Bluzhever Rebbe. They were all subscribers, contributors, and friends who appreciated him and his Torah knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a youngster, my father would take my brother and me with him to the different sages and rebbes he visited. And from 1951, which is when I was born, until after my Bar Mitzvah, we lived in Crown Heights, around the corner from 770, where we would go regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my father walked in the street, he used the time to think about matters of Torah learning, with his mind everywhere but the sidewalk in front of him. One time, he was walking up to 770 for the morning prayers and, unbeknownst to him, the Rebbe was just ahead of him. Had he noticed, he would have slowed to give the Rebbe more space, but instead, just as he got to the door of 770, he saw the Rebbe holding the door open for him. He stopped, but to his surprise, the Rebbe invited my father to enter first! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, my father refused, but the Rebbe insisted: “You are holding &lt;em&gt;tefilin&lt;/em&gt;. You should go first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my father’s requests, the Rebbe declined to write responsa for the &lt;em&gt;Hamaor&lt;/em&gt;, explaining that this was the field of Rabbi Zalman Shimon Dvorkin, the chief Halachic authority of the Lubavitch community. Instead, he submitted articles – edited specifically for &lt;em&gt;Hamaor&lt;/em&gt;, and recently republished in a separate collection – containing his teachings on the weekly Torah portion or an upcoming holiday. They are fascinating teachings, composed so that the average rabbi could appreciate and understand; often, when I need to speak, I take out an old &lt;em&gt;Hamaor &lt;/em&gt;to reference what the Rebbe wrote. For decades, the first fifteen pages or so of each issue were dedicated to these teachings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the article, the Rebbe would also send a check of $1,500 or $2,000. Those checks kept my father going for another month, especially when the journal got involved in various Halachic controversies, and some people pulled their advertisements. So for about thirty years, the Rebbe was the main supporter of the journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1965, living in our area of Crown Heights became very difficult; you could hardly traverse the neighborhood without getting mugged or attacked. So, my father decided to move. He found an old, decrepit building for sale in Borough Park, on the corner of 50th Street and 18th Avenue, and decided to turn the ground floor into a synagogue and a &lt;em&gt;mikveh&lt;/em&gt;, while we could live in an apartment above. Many of the articles that my father wrote were on the subject of &lt;em&gt;mikveh&lt;/em&gt;, and in those days, he felt that this practice– broadly speaking, the laws of Family Purity – was not being observed according to the standards and seriousness it warranted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was that he had no money, and he needed $23,000, so he went to his friends for help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rebbe,” he said, “I need money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe gave him $5,000 and a blessing for success: “Your building is on the corner of 50th and 18th,” he remarked. “That represents the [Kabbalistic] 50 Gates of Understanding and &lt;em&gt;chai&lt;/em&gt; [life]!” After that, my father went to his next friend, the Satmar Rebbe, who contributed another $5,000. The &lt;em&gt;mikveh &lt;/em&gt;is still in use to this day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Rebbe began the practice of handing out dollars for people to donate to charity, my father once went by, and the Rebbe gave him a whole stack of fifty singles. “Rabbi Amsel,” he said, “we have to support you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have those bills today, and I’ve been able to give each of my children and grandchildren a dollar from that stack. When we go over fifty, please G-d, we’ll worry about it then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever my father had an audience with the Rebbe, it lasted for hours. The Rebbe once told him that he liked these meetings because they could converse comfortably. Most people who went to the Rebbe would tell him about their problems, “but with you,” the Rebbe commented, “I can &lt;em&gt;schmooze&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father never shared his private conversations with us, but in 1988, when the Rebbe’s wife passed away, my father went to offer his condolences, and that conversation was recorded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe was obviously feeling deeply distressed at the time, and my father wanted to encourage him. He felt that, as a leader of the Jewish world, the Rebbe could not allow himself to fall into depression. As their conversations always involved Torah, he expressed this sentiment by citing the Talmudic Tractate &lt;em&gt;Yomah&lt;/em&gt;, which states that since the High Priest had to be married in order to perform his duties on Yom Kippur, if his wife passed on the day, he would be required to remarry immediately. To this, my father added that since the Temple service had to be performed with joy, this meant that a Jewish leader could and must be joyful even under such circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to argue with you,” the Rebbe replied, but “there is an entire Talmudic discussion in Tractate &lt;em&gt;Sanhedrin&lt;/em&gt; about how one never forgets the wife of one’s youth.” The Rebbe explained that this is why the Torah describes how Jacob was so brokenhearted at the loss of his wife Rachel. He was still surrounded by a large family, with three other wives and many more children, but that did not console him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the Rebbe was asking, how could someone not be despondent in such circumstances? Having been married for nearly sixty years, the Rebbetzin was the Rebbe’s “wife of youth,” and her passing was a tremendous loss for him. Not many people would have received an answer like that from the Rebbe, but this was how he related to my father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the past &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;twenty-five years, Rabbi Eli Amsel has specialized in preparing rare and antique Jewish books and handwritten manuscripts for auction. He was interviewed in July 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Saved by the Nanny, Adopted by the Rebbe</title>

      <description>A Holocaust orphan who lost her entire family feared raising children without guidance or support. Through the Rebbe's compassionate care and reassurance, she found the strength and confidence to build her family and face the future with hope.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Before the war, life in Warsaw was beautiful. My father was a chemist who did quite well financially, and although they were not very religious, my mother had come from a religious family, and she kept the house kosher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then Hitler came, and everything changed. After we moved into the ghetto, my father got in touch with my gentile nanny and sent me to her. She was like a second mother to me, and I stayed with her until the war was over, which was when I found out that my family had not survived. Barely a teenager, I didn’t want to leave my nanny, but she insisted: “You have your own people to go to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were various Jewish organizations taking care of orphans, and they sent me around to different orphanages, a couple of which were run by Lubavitch. These organizations tried to find out if I had any relatives in other countries who could take me in, but I didn’t have any. Eventually, a couple of years after the war, the Canadian Jewish Congress wanted to bring in a group of 500 orphans, and I ended up being one of those youngsters. We arrived in the port of Halifax on a big boat, before being sent to Montreal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was there, at the age of sixteen, that I met my husband. He was originally from Vienna, but had already been living in Montreal for a few years, after being taken in and then hired as a teacher by the Lubavitcher &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;there. He had an old car, and every day he would come to visit me. He must have liked me and, in May 1950, when I was eighteen, we got married. I was nervous about it, and had absolutely no money, but our wedding was still very nice, and my husband made me feel safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1951, my husband decided that we would go with our son, Yanky, to New York for the holiday of Simchat Torah, in order to see the Rebbe for the first time. This was the year that the Rebbe had succeeded his father-in-law and assumed the position, but I had already heard so much about him and was curious to meet him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We drove to New York, and in 770, we came into a hall where there were a lot of people sitting and waiting for a chance to see the Rebbe. The Rebbe’s secretary told us that it would be a long wait, and everybody seemed to get more nervous and more excited as time went on; some people were crying, some were laughing, and others were reciting Psalms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the secretary opened the door, and we went into the Rebbe’s office. I looked at the Rebbe’s beautiful eyes, and I felt relaxed. He had a kind smile, and there was a very pleasant atmosphere in the room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Is there anything you want to say?” asked the Rebbe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, Rebbe,” I said, and I told him how we had gotten married, had a baby, and now I was expecting my second child. “I would like to have a lot of children and raise them well!” Hitler had taken everything away from me, but I resolved to restore what was lost by having many children, who would want to have children of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But,” I continued, “I’m afraid that I won’t be able to manage. I have no family, so I’m afraid that I won’t know what to do or have anyone to ask for advice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No one?” asked the Rebbe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just my husband, and no one else. I would like it very much if the Rebbe could adopt me. Then I wouldn’t feel alone anymore.” It was an unusual question, but it was what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alright,” said the Rebbe. He took a little black book out of his pocket and wrote down the names for me, my husband, and Yanky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agreed that when I had more children, I would send their names to the Rebbe, so that he could add them to his book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Rebbe told me to always be happy, that everything would be fine, and that he would see me next year. Going through the Holocaust had caused me a lot of unhappiness, but in that moment, I felt very happy. I thanked the Rebbe a million times, and off we went. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came back the next year, and by then we had another baby – Hershy. The Rebbe asked about the children and about me, and I mentioned that I had been taking some medication for a stomach problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe understood what the issue was and had a suggestion: “Don’t use the medication – you can drink Saratoga water instead.” He was talking about the special mineral water of Saratoga Springs, New York; they sell it everywhere now. So, on the way back to Montreal, we stopped off there and got some of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point during that meeting, Rabbi Leibel Groner, one of the Rebbe’s secretaries, began knocking on the door to bring the audience to a close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please, Rebbe,” I begged, “I don’t want to go yet. Tell him to leave us alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing that, the Rebbe told Rabbi Groner that the next person in line would wait until I came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, we would come back every year for Simchat Torah, putting all of the kids into our station wagon and driving to New York. But before long, with no family in New York and so many kids, finding a place to stay became impossible; most people couldn’t handle so many guests!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, one year, I brought it up with the Rebbe. “It feels like everybody’s house is full with their own family,” I complained. “We would love to continue coming every year, but we have no place to stay.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t worry,” the Rebbe reassured me, “You will have a place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we came back the next year, Rabbi Binyomin Klein, another one of the Rebbe’s secretaries and a very nice man, brought us a set of keys. They were for an apartment just behind 770 that was recently purchased by the Rebbe’s office. Later, that building housed a &lt;em&gt;Kollel&lt;/em&gt; for young married men to study Torah, but at that point, it was going unused. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Here are the keys,” he said. “When you are finished, bring them back.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t believe it. We brought some beds to sleep on, and every year, that was where we would stay. I felt that being with the Rebbe in New York for the holidays each year gave me the strength to take care of my kids the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One time, when I confided in the Rebbe about some of my fears and concerns – I was always worried about everything – he told me, “Don’t be a worrier, be a warrior!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt very close to the Rebbe, as if he was my only friend. He understood me and always gave good, compassionate advice. He understood that we needed him, that we believed in him, and trusted that whatever he said was right – and somehow, it always was. He was someone I could count on, and he never disappointed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After surviving the Holocaust, Mrs. Miriaim Fellig, together with her husband Joe, went on to have ten children, and many more grandchildren and great-grandchildren. She was interviewed in January 2009 and passed away in November 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dancing in the Rain</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/667.-Noach-5786.pdf</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/667.-Noach-5786.pdf</guid>
      <description>During Sukkot 1975, relentless rain disrupted efforts to bring holiday joy across New York. A student questioned whether the rain indicated G-d's displeasure, but the Rebbe's response reframed it positively – revealing how the challenge actually created opportunity for deeper connection and learn...</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 1971, after spending several years in Chabad&lt;em&gt; yeshivot&lt;/em&gt; in Israel, I traveled to New York to study Torah in 770, at the court of the Lubavitcher Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, the Rebbe requested that his &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; go out to bring the joy of Sukkot to other Jews by arranging festive &lt;em&gt;Simchat Beit Hasho’eva &lt;/em&gt;celebrations, as they are known. And, for several years afterwards, I was privileged to help direct this special campaign, under the auspices of the Lubavitch Youth Organization. The Rebbe even wanted the many visitors who would come from overseas for the holidays to accompany the groups going out to conduct the festivities. As he explained, the more “fresh faces” there were at these events, the merrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early each afternoon during the intermediate days of Sukkot, several yellow school buses would line up in front of 770 and then disperse groups of &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; to neighborhoods throughout New York where Jewish communities were concentrated – Boro Park, Williamsburg, Flatbush, Queens, and elsewhere. We visited synagogues, played music, danced, and led &lt;em&gt;farbrengens &lt;/em&gt;where words of Torah and &lt;em&gt;chasidut&lt;/em&gt; were shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, I prepared a detailed report of the campaign – with lists of locations, participants, and summaries of our activities – to present to the Rebbe. On the eve of Hoshanah Rabbah, the last day of Sukkot, I would sit down to organize all of the information I had received, aiming to finish the report by around 2:30 AM, when the Rebbe would return to his office after the customary late-night recital of the book of &lt;em&gt;Tehillim&lt;/em&gt; (Psalms). Only afterward did I sit down to recite &lt;em&gt;Tehillim&lt;/em&gt; myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came Sukkot of 1975. From the eve of the festival, a relentless rain began to pour down, for days on end. Needless to say, this made our activities very difficult. I was reminded of the Mishnah in Tractate Sukkah that compares such a situation to “a servant who comes to pour wine for his master, and the master throws a jug of water in his face.” Even though it is the custom of &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; to have their meals in the &lt;em&gt;sukkah&lt;/em&gt; no matter the weather, basic Jewish law states that one is exempt from fulfilling the commandment, and there is no need to eat in the Sukkah, while it is raining. The Mishnah’s parable suggests that when it does rain on Sukkot, it’s a sign that G-d does not desire the servant’s “service,” which no doubt comes as painful disappointment for the servant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know where I got the nerve, but while reflecting on the unceasing rain, I sat down and wrote to the Rebbe:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have been organizing groups to go out across New York to bring festive cheer to our fellow Jews. But since the rain hasn’t stopped, and given our sages’ words that such rain indicates a state contrary to joy – how can we bring joy under such circumstances?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I didn’t expect any answer. Maybe I hoped the Rebbe might give a blessing that the rain would stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next afternoon, at around 1:00 PM, I was boarding one of the school buses to oversee the preparations for the last excursion of that Sukkot, when someone tapped me on the shoulder. “Binyamin,” he said, “you’re being called to the Rebbe’s secretariat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just a few more minutes,” I said, “I need to wrap up a few things here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later the message came again, more insistent: “Come right away!” Realizing that it must be urgent, I hurried inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Binyomin Klein, the Rebbe’s secretary, looked up and said: “The Rebbe answered your letter. Sit and copy it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe had written his response by hand on my note. As was customary, the original page would stay in the secretariat, so I needed to copy it. I assumed it would be a line or two – but to my surprise, the Rebbe’s answer ran over ten lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With barely any time to absorb their meaning, I quickly copied those lines and rushed back to the bus. Then, my heart pounding, I stood up and called out: “Gentlemen, we have an answer from the Rebbe! I’m going to read it to you all now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe’s answer (which was later published in &lt;em&gt;Likkutei Sichot&lt;/em&gt; Volume 14, page 433) contained two main points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, he wrote that surely G-d &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; want us to fulfill the &lt;em&gt;mitzvah &lt;/em&gt;of &lt;em&gt;sukkah&lt;/em&gt;. After all, even with the heavy rain, there had been a few breaks when people were able to recite the holiday &lt;em&gt;kiddush&lt;/em&gt;, recite the blessing for eating in the &lt;em&gt;sukkah&lt;/em&gt;, and even have brief meals inside. “This is clear &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt;, wrote the Rebbe, “that G-d finds pleasure in our service.” With the &lt;em&gt;mitzvah &lt;/em&gt;fulfilled, the rain was simply a sign that G-d wanted us to serve Him elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of the Mishna’s parable, as the Rebbe apparently understood it, is that when someone is prevented from sitting in the &lt;em&gt;sukkah&lt;/em&gt;, he must “leave submissively” and humbly, rather than “kicking and leaving” in frustration, to use the words of the Alter Rebbe’s Code of Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led to a second point: When the &lt;em&gt;sukkah&lt;/em&gt; cannot be used, having to conduct a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt; indoors is not a loss, but an advantage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, as a result of the rain, “according to the Torah the &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt; may and therefore should take place indoors,” it is simply a “sign from Above that it should be held in greater comfort and calmness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, as the Rebbe pointed out, the law is that Torah study and prayer – both of which are integral themes of a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt; – should be held indoors even in good weather if doing so in the &lt;em&gt;sukkah&lt;/em&gt; will be inconvenient or make it difficult to concentrate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thrust of the Rebbe’s message was clear: When you go out to gather other Jewish people inside homes or synagogues instead of &lt;em&gt;sukkahs&lt;/em&gt;, explain that this is no deficiency. On the contrary, Heaven wishes the &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt; to be more comfortable, so that the ideas discussed in it should be absorbed more deeply and with greater joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I understood why the secretariat had called me so urgently: The Rebbe wanted this uplifting message to reach as many Jews throughout the city as possible, that very day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening, when I returned to 770, I was astonished to see copies of the Rebbe’s letter posted on all the walls inside – upstairs and downstairs. Additional sources and references had been added to each point, as the Rebbe often did when preparing something for publication. Although the answer had been addressed to me, it wasn’t about me. The Rebbe’s concern was with the Jewish nation – to affirm that G-d takes pleasure in His people and their service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I walked further inside, I noticed a commotion. Two men were standing and debating heatedly, surrounded by listeners. It was Rabbi Sholom Marozov, a deep Torah scholar and devoted &lt;em&gt;chasid&lt;/em&gt;, arguing passionately with Rabbi Leibel Groner, the Rebbe’s secretary and a great scholar in his own right, about the precise meaning of the Rebbe’s words and his novel interpretation of the relevant Talmudic sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone nearby exclaimed, “There is much to delve into here – but however you read it, the Rebbe is acting in the spirit of the Baal Shem Tov and Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev, the great defenders of the Jewish people, by insisting that they are all righteous and beloved by G-d, and that He surely desires their &lt;em&gt;mitzvot&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Binyamin Silberstrom is one of the founders of the Heichal Menachem &lt;/em&gt;chasidic&lt;em&gt; library in Jerusalem. He also teaches at the Torat Emet &lt;/em&gt;yeshivah&lt;em&gt;, as well as in several Chabad communities throughout the city. He was interviewed in May 2015.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In the 1960s, yeshivah students had annual audiences with the Rebbe, who tailored his approach to each. When a student struggled to grasp Divine Providence, the Rebbe explained that an unlimited G-d who created everything wouldn't abandon His creations, unlike humans who must prioritize.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the early 1980s, the Rebbe stopped receiving individuals for private audiences, but when I was studying in &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt;, in the ‘60s, students were able to have a private audience with the Rebbe every year, in honor of their birthdays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe related to each person in a different way, and for many students, these meetings could be a very powerful experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my class, there was a student, an extremely serious and studious young man, who brought a note into his audience with the Rebbe, in which he detailed all of his perceived personal shortcomings and character flaws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After receiving it, the Rebbe read the note, and then looked up and smiled. “So much &lt;em&gt;lashon hara &lt;/em&gt;(badmouthing) about yourself!” he exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years later, there was another student, a fellow from a prestigious family, who had come from Israel to learn in the &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;in 770 – but he was wasting much of his time instead of focusing on Torah study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he had his private audience, the Rebbe began to chastise him loudly: “Is this why you came here from the Holy Land?” he demanded, his tone audibly upset. “If you don’t want to learn Torah, pack your bags and go home! Why are you wasting your time?” It was very rare for the Rebbe to speak this way, but apparently, it was what this young man needed to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, I had an audience of my own after the festive month of Tishrei. In the note I prepared for the Rebbe, I wrote about something that was bothering me very much. I had been learning about the &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; perspective on Divine Providence, or &lt;em&gt;hashgacha pratit&lt;/em&gt;, which maintains that G-d watches and guides every single aspect of the world. As the Baal Shem Tov – the founder of the &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; movement – put it, every stalk of grain or blade of grass fluttering in every gust of wind is being orchestrated by G-d’s master plan. But I was struggling with this concept. I understood and was capable of articulating the idea, but I didn’t quite &lt;em&gt;connect &lt;/em&gt;with it. So after I discussed the subject with my good friend and study partner, Nachmon Shapiro, we agreed that I should ask the Rebbe about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are certain aspects of &lt;em&gt;hashgacha pratit&lt;/em&gt; that I haven’t internalized,” I wrote in my note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the Rebbe delivered a five-minute lecture on the subject. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer contained a lot of profound material so, not wanting to forget a single word, as soon as I walked out of the Rebbe’s room, I went right over to Nachmon, who was waiting for me in the foyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked out of 770, and sat down on a bench on Eastern Parkway, where I repeated everything the Rebbe had told me. Nachmon then typed it all up, word for word, and the next day I submitted this transcript to the Rebbe’s secretariat, with the request that the Rebbe review what we had written up, seeing as it was on an important subject. Shortly after, the secretaries showed me that the Rebbe had given back the typewritten transcript with his own handwritten corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing the Rebbe had said was that I should discuss the matter further with scholars of &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; thought, and he referred me to a letter of his on &lt;em&gt;hashgacha pratit &lt;/em&gt;that had been recently published in an Israeli periodical. That letter, however, only dealt with some of the more “academic” aspects of the subject, so the Rebbe went on to address my question in a more straightforward way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I found the topic difficult to internalize intellectually, the Rebbe replied that, on the contrary, “It is difficult to understand how someone &lt;em&gt;cannot &lt;/em&gt;believe in &lt;em&gt;hashgacha pratit, &lt;/em&gt;while still believing that G-d created the entire world and everything in it – as we have just learned, ‘&lt;em&gt;In the beginning, G-d created [heaven and earth].&lt;/em&gt;’” These opening words of the Torah, had just been read in the synagogue the previous week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We believe that He created the wind, and that He created the straw,” continued the Rebbe, “so it makes sense that afterwards He would still be thinking about and interested in everything that is going on with that particular stalk or gust of wind. Why would He suddenly lose interest in them?” he asked rhetorically. Even an ordinary person who creates or puts energy into something, presumably continues to care about that thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the Rebbe went on, “When we are speaking of a limited mortal, who can only think about a limited number of things, then if he has five hundred things on his mind, he chooses one hundred of the most important concerns, focuses on them and then he has no choice but to ignore the rest.” (Apparently, the Rebbe considered it normal for a person to have so many things on their mind!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But when we are speaking of the One Above,” he reasoned, “Who is unlimited, Who created so many millions of things, and is certainly capable of thinking about them all, the contrary is true: By logic, why would He suddenly stop thinking about those things? Why would He abandon any of them?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now, if a person has any doubt as to whether G-d created everything, it would be possible to say that He doesn’t concern Himself with everything. But once you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; believe that He created everything, it doesn’t require faith beyond that; [G-d’s interest in every individual creation] is something you can &lt;em&gt;understand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On the contrary,” the Rebbe concluded, “it’s difficult to understand how a person can think otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Avrohom Wineberg has served as the administrator and lecturer for adult Torah education at the Bais Chabad Torah Center of West Bloomfield&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Michigan, since 2000. He was interviewed in March 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Facing financial troubles without telling anyone, a Chabad emissary received the Rebbe's unsolicited blessing for &quot;abundant sustenance&quot;—and immediately received an unexpected large donation.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I first visited the Carolinas as a young &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;student in the ‘70s, when I was sent there as part of Chabad’s summer outreach program and began developing relationships with people from both states. After I got married, my wife Mariashi and I considered moving to Charlotte, the largest city in North Carolina, to serve there as Chabad emissaries on a permanent basis. The Rebbe’s secretary, Rabbi Hodakov, encouraged us to look into it seriously, and when we wrote to the Rebbe about the idea, he gave us his blessing, while instructing us to first build a &lt;em&gt;mikveh &lt;/em&gt;there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years later, though, our mission expanded beyond Charlotte. It was 1988, and I was visiting Crown Heights when I went to see the Rebbe. At that time, the Rebbe was mourning the passing of his wife, Rebbetzin Chaya Mushka, and the regular prayer services were being held in his home. After the service, the Rebbe handed out dollars for people to give to charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went by, the Rebbe looked at me, gave me an extra dollar, and said, with a wave of his hand, “This is for your entire state.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I came home, I told my wife, “Chabad is going to open in Raleigh.” The Rebbe had said “the entire state,” so it had to be in a central place like Raleigh, the capital of North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That very night, I listened to a message on my answering machine. It was from a Jewish lawyer who lived in Raleigh. The committee of Raleigh’s Congregation Shaarei Israel had just met, he informed me, and they had decided that they wanted to partner with Chabad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe’s words were not just a passing remark. When he said, “This is for the entire state,” it was a clear indication that something significant was happening and that we had to respond to it. Indeed, Shaarei Israel ultimately merged with Chabad, and Rabbi Pinny Herman moved to Raleigh to serve as a Chabad emissary there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued to expand in the following years, but in 1991, we fell behind on some bills from a building project. I didn’t tell people about it, but we were facing serious financial challenges. Feeling the pressure, I told my wife that the situation demanded that I go to the Rebbe for Simchat Torah. After arranging for the other Chabad rabbis to conduct the services, I drove up from North Carolina – an eleven-hour trip – with two of my children, arriving on Hoshana Rabbah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That afternoon, the Rebbe was handing out honey cake, as was his custom. When I passed by, he gave me a piece, with a dollar for me to give to charity. But as I started to move on, he called me back, looked at me intently, and gave me another piece with a big smile while he said, “This is so that you should have financial abundance.” Later, I asked my father, who was one of the Rebbe’s secretaries, if he had mentioned anything about my situation. He hadn’t: The Rebbe simply sensed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, Shemini Atzeret, the Rebbe suddenly gave a talk right after the services. During this unexpected talk, the Rebbe gave a series of blessings for the New Year, using all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew Alef-Bet. For the letters &lt;em&gt;chof&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;lammed&lt;/em&gt;, he referred to a “year of abundant sustenance” (&lt;em&gt;kalkalah&lt;/em&gt;) and a “year of abundant Torah learning” (&lt;em&gt;limud&lt;/em&gt;). Then he looked directly at me and reiterated, “Since there will be abundant sustenance, there will be peace of body and mind that allows one to study Torah with abundance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very next day, a member of the Chabad community – a wealthy philanthropist who had heard about the blessing the Rebbe had given me – made a large pledge to be paid over the coming year. It was exactly what we needed, and it was completely unexpected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the morning after the holiday, I wrote a note to the Rebbe reporting the pledge and thanking him for his blessing. Shortly after the morning prayers, my father told me that the Rebbe had received my note and responded that he would mention me in prayer at the resting place of the Previous Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours after that, I was getting ready for the long drive back to Charlotte, but someone suggested I wait just a little longer, as the Rebbe was about to leave 770 to go to the Previous Rebbe’s resting place. “You have one more opportunity to see the Rebbe,” he said. “Why don’t you stick around?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed to my father’s office, which was in the front of 770, not far from the Rebbe’s room. There were a handful of other people standing there when suddenly, the Rebbe’s door opened, and he came out, with my father behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hadn’t expected him to come out so quickly, and so we all just stood there silently, as if frozen. As he walked past us, the Rebbe took out some coins and gave each of us a nickel to put in the charity box affixed to the wall of my father’s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still standing there when the Rebbe suddenly turned back to me and said, “I hear that you already received a donation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then began walking again, but I felt I had to answer. “The Rebbe’s blessing has been fulfilled,” I said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe turned back to give me a penetrating look. He lifted his hand and said, in a raised voice, “This is only the beginning!” Then he turned and walked down the steps to his car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an unforgettable moment: The Rebbe sensed the need of one of his emissaries and responded to it without even waiting to be asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt so energized that, despite barely sleeping for the past four nights, I didn’t need any caffeine to keep me up for the drive back to Charlotte. I could have driven all the way to Cuba on the adrenaline I got from that exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t wish any hardship on anyone, of course, but sometimes I wonder whether those challenging times were worth it just for that exchange, to feel the Rebbe’s presence so directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt how deeply the Rebbe empathized with his emissaries. We couldn’t always be with him, because we had responsibilities in our own communities, but even so, the Rebbe was always there to give the helping hand that we needed to push forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Yossi Groner has served as the leading Chabad emissary to North and South Carolina since 1980. He was interviewed in May of 2013.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

      <title>Riots, Bombings, and Chasidic Music</title>

      <description>Rabbi Noson Gurary brought Judaism to University of Buffalo's radical campus in 1971, reaching over 10,000 students through miraculously approved credited courses in Chasidic Philosophy, Mysticism, and Music. The Rebbe told him, &quot;Since you are doing the work of my father-in-law, he is with you - ...</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I could fill a whole book with my experiences coming straight out of &lt;em&gt;yeshiva&lt;/em&gt; and landing on a college campus in the early 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing so much from the Rebbe about the importance of &lt;em&gt;shlichut&lt;/em&gt;, serving as a Chabad emissary, it was my greatest dream. So, two years after we got married, my late wife and I volunteered. At first, the Rebbe’s office was going to send me to Finland. I knew nothing about the country, but if the Rebbe wanted, we would have happily gone. Then they were looking into Greece, but neither of those options worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, what did materialize was the University of Buffalo. Back then, it was a radical campus, with thousands of Jewish students. Many of them were hippies, and unfortunately, many of them were drifting into other religions and all kinds of different lifestyles. There were riots, and even bombings; it was a wild time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe had received letters from people in the local community describing the situation, and they had requested that someone be sent to work with the Jewish university students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I left, I had a private audience with the Rebbe, in which I asked two questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was about the Vietnam War: The protests and riots on campus were mainly about the American involvement in Vietnam, and I wanted to know how to present the Jewish view on the matter – but the Rebbe advised me to explain that this issue is too complex to weigh in on without knowing all the facts on the ground. This way, I wouldn’t be taking a side in the debate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second question was: What to answer if someone asked me about the difference between a Jew and a non-Jew? This was a very sensitive issue in those days. If a Jew felt that he was in any way superior to others, that could be problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, one of my first experiences on campus involved this question. I had gone to visit the student union building, and the place was popping. Everyone there was shouting for something else; this one was shouting against the war, that one was for the war, and someone else was banging on drums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to the basement, which was known as the Rathskeller. There were students playing pool there, and I struck up a conversation with one of them, a boy with long hair, like everyone in those days. “Are you Jewish?” I asked calmly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was all I needed to say. Turning red, he shot back: “What difference does it make?” Suddenly, a circle of hippies began forming around me. The boy went on: “Is there a difference between a Jew and a non-Jew? If not for the respect I have for my father, I would knock you down right now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe told me to address this question in the following way: “When you build a home, everyone involved has a different role and a different job description – electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and so on. Everyone has a shared purpose, which is to collectively build the home, but if one tried to do another’s job, there would be chaos. So too, the Jewish people have a mission that they share with the other nations of the world, with a common goal, but their jobs are different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank G-d, although I didn’t have the opportunity to share the Rebbe’s answer the first time I encountered the question, I found the courage to go back again, and then again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I did was set up a table in the union building, placing a large picture of the Alter Rebbe, the first leader of Chabad, on the table, along with Jewish artifacts, like a shofar and a &lt;em&gt;kiddush&lt;/em&gt; cup. I also had &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; music blasting from speakers and looked completely out of place, which attracted everyone’s attention. Slowly but surely, students came over – hippies, communists, and kids from every background – and I invited them to our Chabad House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year after I arrived on campus, I received an instruction from the Rebbe that seemed to defy all reason. I had written to the Rebbe about my efforts to organize some Torah classes, and in his answer, he wrote that I shouldn’t teach any classes on campus unless they counted for university credit. At first, this seemed impossible. I had no Ph.D., and what university would accredit my classes? It was a strange answer; setting a condition like that was something only the Rebbe could do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right away, I put together a resume – I had been ordained to serve as a rabbi and a rabbinic judge, and had published several articles in Torah journals, all of which I said were equivalent to a college degree – and submitted an application to teach at the university. Miraculously, they approved. Without exaggeration, that semester alone I taught four credited courses, with midterm papers and finals: Chasidic Philosophy, Jewish Mysticism, Jewish Law, and Chasidic Music as Literature, where I would play &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; melodies from the “Nichoach” series of records and then explain what the melody was about. There could be between forty and a hundred people in a course, and over the years, well over ten thousand students took them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe once wrote to me: “Do you have any idea how amazed I am at how many thousands of students were drawn closer to Torah and &lt;em&gt;mitzvot&lt;/em&gt; through these courses, because” – and he underlined this part for emphasis – “of the fact that you were able to teach for credit?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ten years or so, the university campus moved out to the suburbs, and it became a very different scene. So that there wouldn’t be any more riots, the campus became scattered, with the buildings separated from each other, making it difficult to gather people together. This also made it difficult for me to gather people for Shabbat morning prayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than twenty years, I would spend nearly every Shabbat morning walking through the dorms, knocking on doors, climbing flights of stairs, trying to get nine students out of bed so we could pray with a &lt;em&gt;minyan&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that my efforts did not go to waste, but having to spend hours every Shabbat just trying to bring people together could be depressing. Holidays were even worse for me: I grew up in Crown Heights, where days like Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, or Sukkot were the greatest experiences, celebrated among thousands of people. On those days, campus was very lonely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, I wrote about this sense of loneliness to the Rebbe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since you are doing the work of my father-in-law, the Previous Rebbe, he is with you,” the Rebbe answered. “And &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are also together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had always believed this, but to hear it from the Rebbe himself – that he was with me, that he knew what I was going through – there was nothing stronger than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, I brought a professor to meet the Rebbe, who helped him appreciate the urgency of our work on college campuses. “Nowadays, it is like a house on fire,” he explained, “and we must save every Jew so they won’t be lost.” And indeed, so many students who had been far from Judaism – people who were drawn into other religions, or who hated religion altogether – turned around, and went on to build Jewish families. Some of their children today run Chabad Houses on college campuses themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Noson Gurary established the Chabad House of Buffalo in 1971 and has served in that role for over fifty years. He was also instrumental in establishing Chabad houses on other college campuses in Western New York. He was interviewed in November 2013 and August 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Man Who Flew Over Mount Sinai</title>

      <description>A young widow sent a letter accompanied by a photograph to the Rebbe. The Rebbe encouraged her to remarry while explaining the benefits thereof.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I was born in 1944 in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. We managed to maintain a &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; way of life and to observe every detail of Jewish law, despite the many difficulties we faced in the Soviet Union. The school system made keeping Shabbat particularly difficult and my father spent several years in Siberian exile, on account of his role in helping Chabad &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; smuggle across the border. When I came of age, to avoid the additional challenges of military service, it was decided that I would instead attend university, and since an artistic streak ran in our family, I studied architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About three years after I completed my studies and got married, in 1971, the government granted us exit visas. My wife and I left for Israel, where I eventually found a job working as an architect for the Ashkelon municipality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1975, a little over a year after the Yom Kippur War, a request came from the Ministry of Defense to the municipality. In Ashkelon there lived the widow of an air squadron commander who had fallen in Sinai during the war, leaving her with four small children. The ministry had allocated funds to expand her small single-story home and asked us to assist with planning and construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working on the project, I frequently met with this widow, an extraordinary woman who was dealing heroically with a very difficult situation. Among other things, she told me that her husband had been an avid photographer, taking pictures whenever he could. The Phantom fighter jets then used by the Israeli Air Force had no cameras, so he would take photos from the cockpit. Some of his photographs adorned the walls of her living room, but some two-thousand of them were in storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the Israeli army used some of those photographs in planning “Operation Thunderbolt,” the 1976 rescue of the passengers of an Air France flight that had been hijacked to Entebbe, Uganda. When Uganda was still friendly with Israel, the family had spent four years there while the husband trained local air force pilots, and he also took many photos of the very airport where the hostages were later held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the extension on her home was completed, we stayed in touch, and I would often speak to her about the Rebbe. Before the Tishrei holidays of 1977, I mentioned that my wife, our infant daughter, and I would be spending the month with the Rebbe. Something struck a chord within her and she immediately said, “I want to write a New Year’s greeting to the Rebbe. The children will write too. We love him and want to send a gift.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gift she chose was one of the photographs from her living room. While flying over the Sinai desert, her late husband had taken the photograph of a mountain claimed by some scholars to be Mount Sinai. I came to her house, and she gave me the picture, beautifully wrapped, together with her letter and the heartfelt letters and drawings her children had made for the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On arriving at 770, I delivered the package, and every few days I would check with Rabbi Binyomin Klein, one of the Rebbe’s secretaries, whether the Rebbe had replied. But Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot all came and went and there was still no response. Then, on Simchat Torah, the Rebbe suffered a severe heart attack. As a result, I stopped asking for a response, of course, and we didn’t have a private audience with the Rebbe before returning to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I returned home without an answer, and since I had nothing for the widow, I didn’t rush to call her. One day, the phone rang in my office. “Mordechai, come here right now,” I heard her say urgently. Sensing the emotion in her voice, I asked what had happened, but she only repeated: “Come now!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I arrived at her home, I found her with red eyes from tears. “Mordechai,” she reported excitedly, “we just received five letters from the Rebbe! One for me, and one for each of the children.” She had three daughters and a son, who was only a baby when his father was killed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Rebbe is a prophet like Moses!” she exclaimed. “There are things I never told anyone, only thought in my heart – and the Rebbe writes to me about them!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a long and remarkable letter, which was later published, the Rebbe encouraged her “to be strong in her trust in G-d, Who watches over each and every individual” and to take care of herself “both physically and spiritually.” He blessed her that “from now on you know no pain nor distress, G-d forbid, but only true Jewish &lt;em&gt;nachas&lt;/em&gt; from each of your children, and that you raise them to Torah, marriage, and good deeds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What touched her most were the Rebbe’s words, written with extraordinary sensitivity and empathy, about the importance of getting remarried. Prefacing with a kind of apology, the Rebbe wrote: “Although this may seem an intrusion into a private matter… my feeling and sense of responsibility tells me not to withhold my thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe continued: “The pain and sorrow … of losing a husband and father of the family are clear and valid. Yet together with this, especially since G-d blessed you with children, which places upon you a sacred and pleasant mission – though at times a heavy one – regarding their education, it is also clear that you should try to arrange life in a normal manner, in all its aspects. I refer, simply put, to family life through marriage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather than, as many mistakenly think, hurting the soul of the beloved departed, the opposite is true: When the soul sees, from its place in the World of Truth, that the family life is being built in accordance with the Torah of Truth... this brings true satisfaction to the soul.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe acknowledged the “inner struggle, and not an easy one” in making such a step: “But surely G-d, who creates and guides man, does not abandon him even in a situation that requires extra effort and special strength, and before placing a person in such a situation, He gives them all the powers and abilities needed to overcome it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the children, the Rebbe added that “the younger they are when this is done, the easier it will be for them to adjust to a new presence in the home.” He mentioned that he knew of several similar cases, “and when the widow worked to arrange her life in this way, after a short time she recognized that this was the right path for the children, for herself, and beyond that – for a full and happy life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe concluded his letter with his blessings for the new year. In a postscript, he thanked her for the “precious gift of the photograph taken by your late husband,” even suggesting that a public exhibition of his photo collection be arranged. Her husband’s photograph of the purported site of Mount Sinai, added the Rebbe, is one that “not only shows his aptitude for photography” but also reflect the choice of a subject that is of “heartfelt significance to every Jew – since all souls were present at Mount Sinai when the Torah was given.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mordechai Gorelik&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;is a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;n engineer and architect who resides in Nachalat Har Chabad, Israel. He was interviewed in his home in December of 2013.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In 1974, the Rebbe launched the Candle Lighting Campaign. Leah is just one of many individuals whose life was turned around as a result of the campaign.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When I was nineteen years old, I embarked on my life-long career as a first-grade teacher. This year is my fifty-first year of teaching first grade and I have to say – with apologies to my husband whom I married a year later – that these first-graders were my first love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had spent the whole summer at my parents’ home in Worcester, Massachusetts, preparing for my first job at Yeshiva of Kings Bay in Brooklyn, and then, a few days before school was to start, I returned to an apartment that I shared with several other girls in Crown Heights. I took a taxi for the last part of my journey and, in my excitement, I left my briefcase behind in the cab. That briefcase had all my textbooks and the lesson plans I had prepared so painstakingly. It was irreplaceable! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this was 1974, when there were no cellphones, no internet, no Google. I didn’t even have a phone in my apartment. So, I had to use my upstairs neighbor’s phone to call the cab company, but the answer I got was, “Forget it lady! You are looking for a needle in a haystack.” I was very upset. What was I to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, something unbelievable happened. My neighbor summoned me to the phone because a man named Danny, who identified himself as a jeweler from Bay Ridge, was calling. He had my briefcase! And, he had an amazing story to tell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that after I got out of the cab, a kindly Irishman got in. He noticed the briefcase on the floor and he asked the driver, “Are you going to return it? Somebody must be looking for it.” But the driver just said, “I don’t have time for that!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you mind if I take it and try to find the owner?” the Irishman asked. The driver didn’t mind and didn’t care. So the Irishman took the briefcase home and recognized that the writing on the books inside was Hebrew. Since the only Jew he knew was Danny, the jeweler, he brought the briefcase to him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story could have ended right there. Danny could have said, “I have a business to run. I don’t have time to search for the owner.” The only clue he had was an envelope he found inside from Bais Rivka, the girls’ school I had attended, addressed to me in Worcester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He found the number for Bais Rivka and, luckily, he spoke to someone who knew where I was staying. He got the number for my neighbor and he called, telling me that I could come pick up my briefcase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the next day I traveled to Bay Ridge together with my roommate. When we met Danny – who was not religious – we used the opportunity to speak to him about the many &lt;em&gt;mitzvah&lt;/em&gt; campaigns that the Rebbe was promoting at that time, but he was not interested. “It’s not for me, it’s not for me,” he insisted. But he added that he had a daughter who was exploring Judaism. When we heard that, we said that if she ever wanted to come and spend Shabbat with us, she would be most welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we didn’t leave it at that. As a thank you gift for all the trouble he had gone through, we went back and brought him two &lt;em&gt;mezuzahs&lt;/em&gt; – one for his home and one for his store. We again repeated the Shabbat invitation for his daughter, but nothing came of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then just before Rosh Hashanah, the Rebbe launched his candle-lighting campaign. It was Wednesday, 24&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of Elul 5734 (11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of September, 1974). On this occasion, the Rebbe spoke at length exclusively to women about how the world was deteriorating into moral darkness. He suggested a simple solution – bring light – have all Jewish women and girls light candles before each Shabbat and holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My roommate and I looked at each other, and we agreed that we had to go back to Danny and bring a candle-lighting kit for his daughter. And this we did. Still, we didn’t hear from her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years passed – during which time I got married, had two children, and moved to Los Angeles. One day, out of the blue, I got a letter forwarded to me by my former neighbor. It was from Danny’s daughter, Leah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She wrote that she had received the candle-lighting kit years before and put it to good use. Not only that – the lighting of the candles was just the beginning of her Torah observance. She went on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;About a year after … I began to keep kosher. It was hard in my home, and with my friends eating out, but I have been kosher ever since. When I went away to college, I learned Hebrew and began taking Torah classes one night a week with a few other people in my university. The classes made me want to learn more. This summer I have decided to go to Bais Chana [women’s seminary] in Minnesota to study. I’m sure you’ve heard of it. I’m really looking forward to going. I’m going alone but will not be alone in feeling once I get there. There are girls like me who have had little or no religious background attending. I think it will be a strengthening experience and will help me to see if I want to continue studying [Torah] in the fall as opposed to going back to college. I have been thinking about you for a while now and have always regretted not accepting your Shabbos invitation. I guess I just wasn’t ready then. I had to learn for myself …&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know that a long time has passed since you gave me the candle holder and I’m sure that many more have been passed out among Jewish youth all across the country. But this is timeless. It’s never too late for a person to learn. And I surely wasn’t going to let time get in the way of telling you that you did a great mitzvah. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t believe it. I immediately made a copy of the letter and sent it to the Rebbe, who replied, “Thank you thank you! It’s a &lt;em&gt;mitzvah&lt;/em&gt; to publicize all this! I will mention it at the resting place [of the Previous Rebbe.]” As a result, the letter was printed in various Chabad publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, I heard that Leah was living in Crown Heights raising a beautiful Chabad family of seven children. And then I heard that her son was living in Los Angeles and had married a girl whom I had taught in first grade. Since then, I have taught their children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wonderful, blessed turn of events started way back in 1974 with the Rebbe’s candle-lighting campaign! And it goes to show that, as the Rebbe taught, when you do a &lt;em&gt;mitzvah&lt;/em&gt; you have no idea what ripple effect you are setting in motion and what the end result will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since 1978, Mrs. Ruchama Thaler has served a Chabad emissary in Los Angeles and a first-grade teacher in the local Chabad schools, presently in Bais Chaya Mushka. She was interviewed in February 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Overcome spiritual challenges by learning Chassidic teachings and having a photograph of the Rebbe handy. Inspire students by being a living example of the values you wish to instill.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Even before I was Bar Mitzvah, I had a few audiences with the Rebbe. My father used to travel to the Rebbe from Montreal every year, and from when I was a little boy in the late ‘50s, my brother and I would take turns going with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going into the Rebbe’s room, my father would always write a note about whatever he wanted to say or ask. When we entered, he would give his note to the Rebbe, who then read the whole thing, while making notes with a pencil. He then answered my father’s questions, while I listened, although most of the time, I didn’t understand what exactly my father had asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One time, as we walked into the audience, even before my father had a chance to hand his note to the Rebbe, the Rebbe asked: “How is the sugar doing?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father had diabetes, and he used to take insulin shots every day to regulate his blood sugar. Today, the needles used for those shots are quite different than they were in the 1950s, and some diabetics don’t need to inject anything at all. But back then, the needles were thicker, and taking those shots could be very painful. Knowing how my father suffered from the shots, the Rebbe then added that he should ask his doctor about some of the new medications that were coming out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, my father wasn’t able to take any of those new medications, but the look that I saw on the Rebbe’s face, and the way he cared for his &lt;em&gt;chasid &lt;/em&gt;made an impression on me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he finished answering my father’s questions, the Rebbe would turn to me. “And what are you learning?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year I had been studying Tractate Pesachim in the Talmud, which discusses the laws of Passover. Specifically, we had just learned the Mishnah that says one may eat &lt;em&gt;chametz&lt;/em&gt;, leavened bread, “until four hours” on the day before Passover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I quoted this Mishna, the Rebbe asked, “What does four hours mean? Four o’clock?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No,” I replied. “It means four hours from the beginning of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And when does morning begin?” the Rebbe pressed. “Sunrise or dawn?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure, but for some reason I thought that those hours were calculated from sunrise, so that is what I answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How do you know that it’s from sunrise?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Probably because that’s what my teacher said.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe smiled, and later I learned that there is actually a disagreement among the Halachic authorities when exactly the day starts in this respect. The Alter Rebbe, the founder of Chabad, ruled that it is sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, when kids went to the Rebbe along with their fathers, the Rebbe would ask these sorts of questions. But from my Bar Mitzvah and on, I began asking the Rebbe questions that I had. The custom in those days was that &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;students were able to meet with the Rebbe on the occasion of their birthdays, and I had the great merit of going every year from my Bar Mitzvah until I got married in 1972, and then a couple more times after that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During these audiences – which would last a couple of minutes – the Rebbe would answer my questions. I would ask about issues of concern for a &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; student, such as how to observe a particular Chabad custom, about what area of Torah I should study, about how I prayed, about my inner struggles, or about dealing with the &lt;em&gt;yetzer hara &lt;/em&gt;– the Evil Inclination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year, in response to a question about those struggles, the Rebbe recommended taking a few &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; discourses that focus on developing one’s character – as opposed to the more abstract, intellectual subjects that Chabad &lt;em&gt;Chasidut&lt;/em&gt; often focuses on – and reviewing them several times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; mentor then suggested two particular discourses – one from the Rebbe and another from the Previous Rebbe – and I learned them enthusiastically. But, with time, their effect began to wear off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I went back for my audience the next year, I wrote in my note that it wasn’t working anymore, and I asked what else I should do to help me with my spiritual struggles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Take a photograph of my father-in-law,” said the Rebbe in reply, referring to the Previous Rebbe. “When things are difficult and you feel you are being tested, look at the photograph, and that will remind you that the Rebbe is always looking at you, and that the Rebbe is there. When you reflect on that, it will help you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another occasion, I asked about the attribute of &lt;em&gt;ahavat yisrael&lt;/em&gt;, of having love for a fellow Jew. When I asked the Rebbe how I could develop this feeling within myself, he referred me to &lt;em&gt;Derech Mitzvotecha&lt;/em&gt;, a work from the third Rebbe of Chabad that analyzes the &lt;em&gt;mitzvot&lt;/em&gt; in the light of &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; thought. The Rebbe told me to study the chapter about this commandment, and then to think it over from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, after I got married and became a full-time teacher at the Lubavitch Cheder of Detroit, I asked the Rebbe about how to help my students develop good character, and got slightly different advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was teaching little kids, from five to ten years old, and felt that the main thing I should be doing was providing a good &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; education. That is, even more important than teaching the Talmud or other Torah texts was teaching good personal traits like &lt;em&gt;ahavat yisrael &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;yirat shamayim&lt;/em&gt; – a pious fear of Heaven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in a letter, I asked the Rebbe about it: “How can I implant &lt;em&gt;yirat shamayim &lt;/em&gt;in my students?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t get an answer right away, and after a few months had passed, I stopped expecting one. But the Rebbe still kept the question in mind. In response to another letter I had written to notify him of the recent birth of one of my children, I received a letter with the Rebbe’s standard blessings that he would send on such occasions, and at the bottom there was additional note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In answer to your question about implanting &lt;em&gt;yirat shamayim&lt;/em&gt; in one’s students: &lt;em&gt;lehar’ot dugma chaya&lt;/em&gt; – by showing a living example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, if I wanted to have an influence on my students, it wouldn’t be by lecturing them but by being a living example of how they should act. I didn’t need to search for any tricks or shortcuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Bentzion Stein serves as the executive director &lt;/em&gt;of &lt;em&gt;Detroit’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Lubavitch Cheder, where he first began teaching in 1974. He was interviewed in March 2025. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Right to be Different — and Right</title>

      <description>Rabbi Feller mobilized 200 boys at a BBYO convention to put on tefillin, with the Rebbe demanding it be repeated and offering to fund the effort.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Just before the Six-Day War in 1967, the Rebbe initiated a campaign to encourage Jewish men to put on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;. His emissaries in Israel responded by putting &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; on with the soldiers, and the campaign spread worldwide. The Rebbe was the only leader who gave our people hope at that time, with the help of this campaign, and so, when the war ended in a great victory, setting off a tremendous awakening among Jewish people, &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; became a symbol of that victory. Ariel Sharon, one of the heroes of that war, was photographed wearing &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; at the liberated Western Wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe was very pleased with all this, but eventually, enthusiasm for this campaign began to wane. Six months later, around Chanukah time, the Rebbe put out a call to rev things up again by going out to the youth and encouraging them to put on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happened, I had just the opportunity. After moving to the Twin Cities as a Chabad emissary, I had done a lot of work with the B’nai B’rith Youth Organization (BBYO), and that Chanukah, I was invited to be a keynote speaker at their regional convention. The convention was taking place in a high school in Highland Park, S. Paul, close to where we lived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three very different speakers had been invited for the three-day event: A hippie from the famous Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, a member of the Black Panthers, and me. I would be opening the second day of the convention, speaking to about 200 Jewish boys and 250 Jewish girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, I wrote to the Rebbe about the convention – with an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over the program beforehand, I had noticed that something was missing. “You’re a Jewish organization,” I told the organizers. “How come there are no prayer services here?” BBYO was not an organization devoted to promoting religious observance, but still, I insisted that there should be services before I spoke, with the boys putting on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; and the girls having a special service of their own. They agreed and gave me half an hour, from 8:30 to 9:00 in the morning, for &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; and prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had really stuck my foot in my mouth with this plan, because now I had a problem: Where was I going to come up with two hundred pairs of &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months earlier, two &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; students named Shmuel Shpritzer and Shalom Ber Kalmanson had come out to the Twin Cities from New York for a summer visitation program, so I called them to see if they could come back. “We have an opportunity to really rev up the &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; campaign,” I said over the phone, “but I need you to get as close as you can to two hundred pairs of &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;.” Shpritzer and Kalmenson went off running to every Judaica store in New York and managed to buy 137 sets of &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;, at $18 each. This was a long time ago; today you can’t even buy the leather straps for that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that presented another problem: Where was I going to get the money for so many pairs of &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;? But when I wrote about what I was doing to the Rebbe, he responded: “This is an extraordinary &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; campaign. The cost will be covered from here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; boys flew in with 137 pairs of &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;, and together with Rabbi Asher Zeilengold, the rabbi of our synagogue, we went to the convention on the next day, which was a Wednesday. Before the official opening on that first day, we got about twenty or thirty boys to put on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, on Thursday, Rabbi Zeilengold put together a creative prayer service for the girls in the school auditorium, while Shpritzer and I met with the boys in the music room. With the boys sitting around the room on tiered bleachers, the director of B’nai B’rith, a good friend of mine named Ralph Birnberg, served as a model for how to put on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;. In the meantime, we ran around the room making sure that everyone was wearing them correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recited the blessing together and then, because it was early enough, we recited the morning Shema, so that way we were able to fulfill two &lt;em&gt;mitzvot&lt;/em&gt; at once. We did the same thing with the sixty remaining boys, and managed to finish within half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, for my keynote speech, I spoke about the convention’s theme: The Right to Be Different. “You have the right to be different,” I told the crowd, “but only if, in being different, you are being right. And the only way to know what is truly right is to look Above. It’s G-d Who determines absolutely what is good and what is not; otherwise, everything is just relative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, I called the Rebbe’s secretary, Rabbi Hodakov, to proudly report that we had put &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; on with 200 boys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling exuberant, I hadn’t realized that the Rebbe himself was listening in on another extension. Suddenly, I heard his voice, in Yiddish: “And what about tomorrow?” the Rebbe asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want to overdo it!” I said. The fact that B’nai B’rith had happily opened their convention with &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; in this way was already unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this, there is no overdoing,” he replied. “You should go and tell them that they must do it again tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was saying, &lt;em&gt;I don’t want to overdo it&lt;/em&gt;, but the Rebbe was telling me, &lt;em&gt;do it again!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he asked, “Was the press there? Television?” And then, “Did you light Chanukah candles?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I often invite the press to our events, but this wasn’t our thing – it was a BBYO event. Still, the Rebbe wanted this to be a real public statement, and something that would be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he added, “Tell them that we will pay fifty percent of the cost for any boy who wants to buy a pair of &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can imagine how I felt as I went back to tell all of this to Ralph Birnberg. I whispered a chapter of Psalms and went to speak with him. “The Rebbe was so pleased that the convention started with &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;,” I stammered, “that he suggested we do it again tomorrow.” I waited with bated breath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Great idea!” replied the director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Rebbe also said he’ll cover half the cost for any boy who wants to buy &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;,” I added, to which Ralph responded: “And B’nai B’rith will pay another twenty-five percent.” Now, each boy could buy a set of &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; for $4.50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I reported to Rabbi Hodakov that we would be able to do everything that had been asked of us, he called me back about two minutes later to say that the Rebbe had written a little note for me: “Thank you, thank you, thank you for the good news.” One “thank you” from the Rebbe – or “&lt;em&gt;teshuot chein&lt;/em&gt;,” in the Hebrew expression he often used – was a big deal. Two was amazing. Three was extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, we did it again. We managed to obtain some more &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; in the meantime, and Rabbi Zeilengold again led a special prayer service for the girls with Modeh Ani, Shema, and an inspiring sermon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything worked out beautifully, and the story was covered in every Anglo-Jewish newspaper in the world. Sometime later, I heard that a certain rabbi from Baltimore was visiting the Rebbe, and saw that there were pictures of us putting on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; with the boys on his table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In general,” the Rebbe remarked to the rabbi, “I am not an excitable person. But from this, I am excited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Moshe Feller has served as the leading Chabad emissary to Minnesota since 1961. He was interviewed in November 2005 and November 2010.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MEN ON A MISSION</title>

      <description>Handpicked by the Rebbe and guided by his ongoing communication, Rabbi Minkowitz reflects on his groundbreaking mission to Australia.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It was a Thursday night in early 1967 and we were studying at the &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;in 770, when Rabbi Binyomin Klein, one of the Rebbe’s secretaries, walked over to me with a message. Rabbi Hodakov, the senior secretary, wanted to see me once the evening study session was over at 9:30 PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was almost unheard of. Rabbi Hodakov would not normally call over a &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;student&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and if he did want to see me, that meant the Rebbe had something to do with it. Had I done something wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Am I the only one being called?” I inquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are a few others,” was the answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That consoled me somewhat; if there was some kind of problem, at least I wouldn’t be on my own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 9:30, I went to Rabbi Hodakov’s office at the end of the corridor on the ground floor of 770, along with several other students. It was the size of a closet, but he wasn’t the type to mind, and somehow he managed to run the Rebbe’s entire operation from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Squeezed inside that office, we were informed that we had been chosen to go to Melbourne, Australia. A Chabad &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; for local high school graduates had just opened up, and it needed support while getting established. We would help form the nucleus of the student body, while also studying with and encouraging the local students. It was the first time the Rebbe had sent such a group – which he later called “emissary-students” – and we would be there for a two-year posting. However, Rabbi Hodakov had three conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number one, we were not being compelled to go. If we went, it had to be because we wanted to go, “happily, and with a joyful heart.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second condition was that our parents had to approve; and third, we had to get a doctor to confirm that we were in proper health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Is this coming from the Rebbe?” someone asked. We noticed that Rabbi Hodakov hadn’t mentioned the Rebbe at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Hodakov was always diplomatic in the extreme, and he avoided answering this question. “If I tell you that it is coming from a certain source, you’ll feel compelled to go,” he reasoned, “and we just said that you have to go because you want to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When will we go?” called out somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “As far as we are concerned, you can go tomorrow, but first you need to get the proper papers and tickets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, we heard from Rabbi Dovid Raskin, one of the administrators of the &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt;, about the source of these instructions. “We didn’t even suggest any names for the Rebbe to choose from,” he insisted. “You were personally selected by the Rebbe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before long, we were able to report back to Rabbi Hodakov that we had met all the conditions, which he then relayed to the Rebbe after the morning prayers on Shabbat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On hearing the news, the Rebbe informed Rabbi Hodakov that he would be holding a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen &lt;/em&gt;that day&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Nobody had expected this. In those days, the Rebbe typically only led a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen &lt;/em&gt;once a month on Shabbat and special occasions, but this was just a regular day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;, the Rebbe spoke at length about our mission to Australia, by referring to the story of the upcoming holiday of Purim. As it was said of Mordechai at the end of the Megillah story: “His fame spread through all the lands.” So too, said the Rebbe, “the time has come to send people off to a far-flung corner of the world, to bring the wellsprings of &lt;em&gt;Chasidut&lt;/em&gt; there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe blessed our departing group, poured each of us a &lt;em&gt;l’chaim&lt;/em&gt;, and as everyone sang, he stood up, clapped, and danced while singing along – all of which was extraordinary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, on the night before our group of six emissary-students was set to leave, the Rebbe invited us for a private audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over twenty minutes, he defined the goals of our trip to Australia, which was “to bring the light of Torah and &lt;em&gt;mitzvot&lt;/em&gt; there, including the light of &lt;em&gt;Chasidut&lt;/em&gt;,” as well as to influence “the entire Melbourne, then all of Australia, to turn it into a &lt;em&gt;chasidic &lt;/em&gt;country.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe continued: “For &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt;, and especially &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;students, everything starts with the study of Torah, so this should be your primary role.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he also added that in our spare time, and in a way that would not interfere with our studies, we could also work with the local outreach organizations. It wasn’t the reason we were being sent, but the work of spreading Judaism would ultimately elevate our own studies – and therefore, it became significant in its &lt;em&gt;own &lt;/em&gt;right. The Rebbe discussed this concept at great length, citing examples from Jewish law, the Talmud, and other Torah sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, though, our main task was “to study Torah continually and diligently, in a way that leads to the scrupulous performance of the &lt;em&gt;mitzvot&lt;/em&gt;, and to serve as an example to others.” Those words, which the Rebbe reiterated several times during the twenty-minute audience, are still ringing in my ears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our flight on Qantas Airways was set to leave the next afternoon. The Rebbe prayed the afternoon service an hour earlier than usual, so that we could join him without missing our flight. From there, we went straight to the cars and buses taking us to the airport. At the Rebbe’s request, the entire &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; accompanied us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the Rebbe himself came outside the front door of 770 to see us off. It was drizzling lightly, and somebody held an umbrella over his head, while he waited for us to pull out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the next twenty-five months in Australia learning Torah, without missing a minute from the &lt;em&gt;yeshivah’s &lt;/em&gt;daily study schedule, which started at 7:00 AM and ended at 9:30 PM every weekday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after we arrived, we were asked to teach a weekly Torah class for the local community. It would be at 9:00 PM on Wednesdays, in a private home, and we would do it on a rotating basis. But when the idea was put to the Rebbe, he immediately rejected it, while expressing his surprise at the question. Other students could teach the class, he wrote, “but not the six that have traveled there as emissaries, on a special mission… unless it is entirely outside of their scheduled studies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there were some other opportunities for communal activities outside of the &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;schedule. We helped run a two-week camp during the Australian summer vacation, and I spent a week with a colleague doing outreach work in Adelaide, South Australia. During Sukkot, we went to Sydney for a few days, to go around speaking to hundreds of Jewish public-school students about Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Several years after we had come back from Australia, I was walking on Kingston Avenue in Crown Heights, when a &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;student approached me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Were you in Australia a few years ago?” he asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” I replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And did you go to Randwick Boys’ High School and speak about the Four Species of Sukkot?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes. But who are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His name is Aryeh Solomon. “When my friends and I saw you guys get up there and speak about Judaism with such confidence,” he explained, “we decided that we had to be like you. We left that public school and ended up going to &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt;.” Today, he lives in Sydney, and is a Chabad emissary himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Yosef Minkowitz has been the principal/dean of the Beth Rivkah Academy in Montreal since 1973. He was interviewed in January 2011 and February 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WE WILL PREVAIL</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/658.-Reeh-5785.pdf</link>

      <description>Mr. Newman built a connection with the Rebbe, leading to impactful outreach work like “Uncle Moishy.” Years later, the Rebbe redirected his plans to Israel, assigning him a mission to help a boy rediscover Judaism — a challenge that ultimately changed the boy’s life.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When I was thirteen, a Modern Orthodox boy studying at Toronto’s Etz Chaim school, I remember learning about Moses before he passed away. He approached G-d and said, “The people need a leader to take my role,” and so G-d told Moshe to appoint Joshua.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can’t imagine that G-d would leave us without a leader today&lt;/em&gt;, I thought. &lt;em&gt;So&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;who is it&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, after looking around the Jewish world in the late ‘60s, I identified a number of great rabbinic leaders for the post-Holocaust generation. But only one addressed world issues, and spoke about matters pertaining to the White House, to Israel, and to every single Jew. This was the Lubavitcher Rebbe. I decided that I wanted to have some kind of relationship with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began reading a weekly pamphlet that had the Rebbe’s teachings on the Torah portion. I also began writing letters to him, and I received many responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduating high school in the ‘70s, I became very involved with the National Conference of Synagogue Youth (NCSY), an outreach program for unaffiliated Jewish teens in public schools. I also took part in a project called “Torah Tour” along with a group of storytellers and musicians. For two summers, we toured Jewish camps in Ontario and Quebec, doing &lt;em&gt;kumzitz &lt;/em&gt;singalongs for the campers and staff, and giving out various Jewish souvenirs supplied by Chabad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years later, I noticed that there weren’t any touring bands for Jewish children. So along with a few of those musicians, we created “&lt;em&gt;Uncle Moishy and the Mitzvah Men&lt;/em&gt;,” which went on to produce 23 albums, 30 videos, and numerous world tours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through NCSY, I had met two music producers from New York named Suki Berry and David Golding, better known as Suki and Ding, who had made hit records for the &lt;em&gt;chasidic &lt;/em&gt;singers Avraham Fried and Mordechai Ben David. So I gave them a call and they ended up coming to Toronto to work on the first &lt;em&gt;Uncle Moishy&lt;/em&gt; album. We used the recording studio that belonged to Geddy Lee, a proud Jew who was also the lead singer of the Canadian rock band Rush, and the resulting Uncle Moishy album became the second bestselling Jewish music album in North American history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we put the music out, we wrote to the Rebbe about the project, and he replied with a few suggestions. One of them was to make sure that the music spoke to little girls as well as boys. “Make sure that there are girls on the album cover,” he told us, “not just boys.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before then, in early 1978, while I was working at an NCSY retreat, I met a teacher named Rochel Hirschprung, and we got married that summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mid-eighties, my wife and I began planning to move to Israel, which had always been a dream of mine. We chose schools for our children, and I had plans to start a beginner’s &lt;em&gt;minyan&lt;/em&gt; at the Kotel, in addition to a daily Torah study program for learning Mishna, Talmud and the works of Maimonides. My wife is a skilled social worker and therapist, so we knew she’d have work there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote an eight-page letter to the Rebbe, detailing our plans. I also wrote about all of the things I had been involved with in the Toronto community – I was on the board of this, the president of that, and was assisting various individuals – so I detailed how other people would replace me in each of these positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, Rabbi Leibel Groner, the Rebbe’s secretary, called me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please get your letter,” he instructed me, “and take out a pen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took out my copy of the letter I had written and got ready to transcribe the notes the Rebbe had written on the copy I had sent to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cross out the first line,” he said. “And the second line. And the third line.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on it went, until the entire page was crossed out, and then almost the entire letter. He was telling me that the Rebbe had read every line and was saying, &lt;em&gt;No, no, no&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; You should not move to Israel! &lt;/em&gt;He wanted me to continue my activities in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the final page, I had mentioned a young boy and his mother – a friend of my wife’s – whom we had been in touch with. There, the Rebbe circled the boy’s name and wrote: “Bring him into the covenant of Abraham our Father.” In other words, the Rebbe was informing me that this boy, who was already nine-years-old, still hadn’t been circumcised, a critical rite of passage for every Jewish boy. Now he wanted me to make sure that this boy had a connection to Judaism – to the covenant between the Jewish people and G-d – and especially through this fundamental &lt;em&gt;mitzvah&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole response was quite shocking, but the leader of the generation had given me a mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mother and son both readily agreed. But it still wasn’t simple to accomplish because by Canadian law the father also had to sign off on a circumcision. He was estranged from his son and refused to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right around this time, the corporation I worked for suddenly asked me to head their Western Canada division, and they wanted to fly me out to Alberta – which was exactly where this mother and son lived – as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flew out for Shabbat, invited the mother and son to the home of Rabbi Menachem and Rochel Matusof, who had just opened up a Chabad branch in Calgary, Alberta, and got everyone introduced. As the boy got older, he learned the Alef-Bet, and had a Bar Mitzvah. But when we wanted to take him on a trip to Israel for a few weeks in the summer, the father refused again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After four years of this, I wrote to the Rebbe to say, “I don’t think this is going to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe wrote back with four powerful words: “&lt;em&gt;Sof sof, didan notzach – &lt;/em&gt;eventually, we will prevail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understood that I should not be discouraged by this obstacle. We stayed the course and even went to court so that this boy could visit Israel. Together with his mom, they came to us in Toronto many times, and I took him on a couple of weeklong “Inward Bound” camping trips with a Chabad group from the Twin Cities. The mother also began a dialogue with the Rebbe, writing to him many times, and he would reply with long letters, telling her how proud he was that she was using her Hebrew name, or advising her on which profession to go into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this boy turned eighteen, he called me up. “I’m old enough to make my own decision now, and I’m ready to have a &lt;em&gt;brit&lt;/em&gt;,” he told me. So he came to Toronto and my brother-in-law, a senior &lt;em&gt;mohel&lt;/em&gt; and urological surgeon, performed the circumcision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was unbelievable. He eventually went to study in the Ohr Sameach &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;in Jerusalem for two years, and then moved in with us, while he went to school in Toronto. Thank G-d, we also helped him find a match for marriageand today, he and his wife have five children together. They are very committed Jews and are all sweeter than NutraSweet. He is a good father, a good husband, and a good Jew. The Rebbe was right: We prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zale Newman is an educator and community activist, the former International Director of NCSY, and the founder of Bond Street Mercantile, a financial services company focusing on investment in Canada and Israel. He was interviewed in July 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FILLING IN THE BLANK</title>

      <description>Success takes time to bore fruit; the more effort - the more success. An emissary of the Rebbe has no reason to doubt or question their abilities.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My husband and I were sent as emissaries of the Rebbe, to Milan, Italy, in 1958. Beforehand, though, during a private audience with my husband, Rabbi Gershon Mendel Garelik, the Rebbe mentioned another Jewish community in the region that we should try to connect with. As he described it, there was “a &lt;em&gt;shtetl&lt;/em&gt; near Milan of &lt;em&gt;chasidim &lt;/em&gt;who are not learning &lt;em&gt;Chasidut&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe was referring to the town of Lugano, just over the Swiss border, and in fact, not long after we arrived in Milan, I received an invitation to speak to the women of that community, who were having a gathering of some kind. As a result, I developed a relationship with this group of women, and whenever they would get together, they would ask me to come speak. I would share one of the Rebbe’s talks whenever I spoke, and so I felt quite proud that I was able to teach &lt;em&gt;Chasidut&lt;/em&gt; to the people of this town that the Rebbe had mentioned to my husband. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 1965, the ladies of Lugano invited me to come for a Sunday. They asked me to give one lesson to girls during the afternoon and another lesson at night to the women. So, I decided to prepare two different classes; that way, if any of the girls from the afternoon class decided to also attend the night class, they would learn something new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave the first class, which went wonderfully, and once again, I felt very proud of myself. Some of the girls even came back for the evening glass, so I was glad that I had prepared the second talk from the Rebbe. I spoke for about forty minutes, I think I delivered the talk well, and then I was finished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The room was silent for a moment, before one of the ladies spoke up: “Keep going,” she said encouragingly. “Talk some more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she said that, my mind went blank. I couldn’t think of a single thing to say. It was truly strange: This was a period of time when a group of girls would come over to my home every single week to learn a talk of the Rebbe – so something should have been in my head. But I couldn’t recall anything. A minute or so passed, before they started to sing some songs instead, and then the event was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The train ride back to Milan was an hour-and-a-half long, and I cried the whole way. I was devastated. The fact that I taught two Torah classes in one day gave me no satisfaction. The fact that I was reaching out to another Jewish community gave me no satisfaction. All I could dwell on was that this group of women had asked me for more but I didn’t have any more to give. &lt;em&gt;Here we are, begging for people to study some Torah&lt;/em&gt;, I thought to myself. &lt;em&gt;But when they ask me to speak, I don’t have anything to say&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At around this time, I had been struggling to convince the local Milanese community to support the Jewish day school we had just started. People couldn’t even understand what we were doing. “A Rebbetzin doesn’t make a school; a Rebbetzin makes &lt;em&gt;kugel&lt;/em&gt;,” was the sentiment. Frustrated by the lack of interest, I had written to the Rebbe: “I feel like my soul was sent down to this earth just to knock on doors and hear people tell me ‘no.’ If that is my purpose, then so be it, but it all seems like such a waste.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the story in Lugano, I felt so defeated that I began worrying whether I was the right person for the job. It wasn’t that I ever wanted to go back to New York or abandon our mission, G-d forbid, but it seemed that there was something wrong with what I was doing. If I wasn’t doing a good enough job, and I wasn’t being successful, maybe I wasn’t worthy of being the Rebbe’s emissary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After feeling depressed for a couple of days, I sat down to write another letter to the Rebbe, describing exactly what had happened and how I was feeling. “Some of my classmates at Beis Yaakov were such smart girls,” I lamented. “Had the Rebbe sent one of them, who knows what she could have accomplished in my place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reply, I got a beautiful full-page letter from the Rebbe, in English. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the literature of &lt;em&gt;Chasidut&lt;/em&gt;,” the Rebbe wrote, the communal work with which we were involved is “classified and explained under two categories: ‘seeding’ and ‘planting.’ The difference is this: In the case of seeding, as for example, sowing wheat, the fruits take less time to appear than in the case of planting a tree.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can sow wheat, and it will grow quickly, but how precious is it? Meanwhile, if you plant a tree, it takes years to grow, but once it does, it will produce a multitude of valuable fruits year after year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same applies, wrote the Rebbe, to “the efforts and activities of a human being” and so, if “it sometimes takes longer for the efforts to come to fruition, this is no reason for discouragement; on the contrary, the reason may well be that it is a case of ‘planting,’ where the ultimate results will be infinitely greater.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the light of the above,” he continued, “it is surprising to me that you should have any doubt about ability, or the success of your efforts, etc.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe’s explanation was wonderful, but then he added the following precious words: “It would appear as if you have doubts as to whether the one who gave you the assignment had made a wise choice. Surely you do not entertain such a thought, though in any case I would not consider it in any personal way, as far as I am concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However, if you are certain that the one who gave you the assignment has not made a mistake, then you should continue your work with certainty and with confidence, and with G-d’s help you will succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading this part of the letter, where the Rebbe wrote that he wouldn’t take it personally if I doubted his decision to make us his emissaries, I realized it wasn’t a statement I would expect from a Rebbe. The language was closer, more intimate, than that of a Rebbe to a &lt;em&gt;chasid&lt;/em&gt;. They were, I realized, the words of a father to a child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Rebbe’s assurance that “surely you do not entertain” those doubts gave me much more self-confidence. He made it clear that if I was confident in him, that meant I needed to have confidence in myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are struggles that every Chabad emissaryhas, but the Rebbe always has a way to offer comfort and support. Even when it seemed to me that I was accomplishing nothing, the Rebbe saw that I was doing important work. And he helped me understand that it might be some time before I see the results. Knowing that success doesn’t come immediately is a tremendous help. I never had those doubts again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mrs. Bassie Garelik has served as a Chabad emissary in Milan, Italy, since 1958, along with her husband, Rabbi Gershon Mendel Garelik, who passed away in 2021. She was interviewed at her home in Milan in January 2009.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KNOW WHENCE YOU COME</title>

      <description>Mr. Kremnizer developed a deep personal relationship with the Rebbe despite being initially ignorant as to what a Rebbe is.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I was born in Bombay, India, where my parents fled when the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939. They had first tried to enter Israel but were prevented by the British who then controlled the so-called “Mandate for Palestine.” Neither could they obtain a visa for America, so they took the next best option. They lived in India for seven years and then immigrated to Australia when I was three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was brought up in a home that was largely devoid of any kind of Jewish education; in fact, I’d describe my father as anti-religious. Because of his views, shaped largely by the Holocaust, I was sent to an elite non-Jewish school, and it was not until I was in my 30s that I learned anything about Judaism. Before I encountered Chabad, I hardly knew what Yom Kippur was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when my father was dying, he told me that – while he didn’t approve of my exploration of Judaism – he felt that I needed to know that we descended from an illustrious &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; family: the Kremnitzer Rebbe and his Rebbetzin, who was the daughter of the Maggid of Mezritch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year after my father died, in 1975, I was involved in a business deal. Without going into the details, I was asked by a Chinese national from Hong Kong to purchase a property in Sydney, which was to be resold to a foreign government seeking an embassy building. A large profit was to be made on this transaction, and I agreed to get involved, provided that the details of the deal be disclosed to the buyer. I was promised they would be, but when at the last moment I learned they would not be, I backed out. However, I thought it unfair that the Chinese partner should profit from my disengagement and it was agreed that my share of the profit would go to a charity of my choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how a donation of $150,000 (which is almost a million dollars in today’s money) was offered to the Chabad &lt;em&gt;yeshivah, &lt;/em&gt;headed by Rabbi Pinchus Feldman, the Rebbe’s emissary in Sydney. Rabbi Feldman was bewildered by this massive sum and he asked me to write to the Rebbe about it, though he did not specify what I should say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I had been learning Torah with Rabbi Feldman for a while, I did not understand the religious world as yet, and I did not know who the Rebbe was. Today, I am very embarrassed – from the top of my head to the very soles of my feet – about the extent of my ignorance and the letter that I wrote to the Rebbe back then. It went along the lines of, “Hello! How are you mate? I heard you are a Rebbe. I am kind of a Rebbe too, because my father told me I descend from the Rebbe of Kremnitz. So as one Rebbe to another, I’m just saying hello from Sydney, Australia, and if I can help you in any way, please let me know. Anyway, cheers, good luck, bye.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I didn’t get a reply to that letter. Nor did I get a reply to any of the more proper letters I subsequently sent as I became more Jewishly knowledgeable. Finally, in 1984 – when I was involved in starting a religious high school for girls and reported to the Rebbe on the progress of this project – I got my first reply. He wrote: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May G-d grant you the fulfillment of your heart’s desires for good in the matters that you wrote. There is surely no need to emphasize to you at length that since all blessings come from G-d and the channel to receive them is through the everyday life and conduct in accordance with His will, every additional effort in matters of Torah and &lt;em&gt;mitzvot&lt;/em&gt;, though a “must” for their own sake, widens these channels. And, of course, there is always room for advancement in all matters of goodness and holiness, Torah and &lt;em&gt;mitzvot&lt;/em&gt;, which are infinite, being connected with The Infinite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odd thing about the letter was that my name was spelled differently – both in the body of the letter and on the envelope – to the way I spell it. This was clearly intentional – and not just a typo – because the typed name was twice corrected by hand to read “Kremnich.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some research into this and I learned that, two hundred years ago, this is how my name would have been pronounced, so I surmised that the Rebbe was gently acknowledging my embarrassing letter of eight years prior where I mentioned my lineage, and doing so with a smile and good wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally was able to meet the Rebbe in 1985. In advance of traveling to New York, I wrote to tell him about my Torah studies. In particular, I’d had a very difficult time learning Hebrew and put in much effort until, at last, I was able to read and comprehend the holy texts by myself. This is what I was most proud of and what I triumphantly shared in my letter, asking for a blessing for continued success in my efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time, the Rebbe was no longer granting private audiences, but it was possible to speak with him as he was handing out dollars for charity. I will never forget when my turn came and I was pushed forward by the crowd and stood in front of the Rebbe. Everyone who has waited in line to receive a dollar understands what an awe-inspiring experience it was to find oneself suddenly face-to-face with the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember looking into his piercing blue eyes and seeing his warm smile and taking the dollar. He said something to me, but I had no idea what. No idea whatsoever. And then I was directed to move forward to make room for the next person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Yanky Barber who was behind me said afterwards, “That was very curious.” I didn’t understand what he was referring to, but he explained: “The Rebbe spoke to you in &lt;em&gt;lashon hakodesh – &lt;/em&gt;in biblical Hebrew, not in modern Hebrew.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I immediately understood why he did that – it was because I had written that letter, boasting that I was able to learn Torah on my own. And the Rebbe acknowledged that by speaking to me in &lt;em&gt;lashon hakodesh&lt;/em&gt; (which I didn’t understand as well as I thought).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the Rebbe had some kind of mental storehouse for every person who ever shared a personal piece of information with him. It’s as if he somehow preserved it all in his memory and brought out the recollection at the appropriate occasion. And that to me is simply incredible – but just one of the many incredible traits that this holy man possessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Robert Kremnizer is an attorney practicing law in Sydney, Australia. He is also the author of ten books on &lt;/em&gt;Chassidut, &lt;em&gt;including a collection of first-hand experiences with the Rebbe entitled &lt;/em&gt;Australian Encounters. &lt;em&gt;He was interviewed in August 2017. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>THE REBBE’S TEFILLIN</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/655.-Devarim-5785.pdf</link>

      <description>In 1959, Mr. Shelly Baer joined to fight in the Korean War. Before departing, the Rebbe gifted him a pair of Tefillin which became an indispensable lifeline.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When I was drafted into the US Army in 1959, I went to see the Rebbe for a blessing, which he gave me. The Rebbe’s blessings don’t expire, so I didn’t think there was a need for another one after I got orders to ship out to Korea – back then, a site of continued armed conflict despite the armistice of 1953. So, imagine my surprise when I went to bid goodbye to my mother and she said, “Sholom, we got a call from Chabad Headquarters. The Rebbe wants to see you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I went right away. The Rebbe greeted me with a big smile and opened with, “I hear you’re going overseas. To Korea, no?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I confirmed that this was indeed the case, he summoned his secretary, who came in carrying a &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; bag, which he put on the Rebbe’s desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sholom, I’m sending you with these &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;,” the Rebbe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I owned a perfectly good pair of &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; from the time of my Bar Mitzvah, which had taken place just five years prior, so I didn’t see why I needed another pair, but the Rebbe didn’t explain. He merely said, “I want you to promise me that you are going to put these on every day and say the &lt;em&gt;Shema&lt;/em&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Because I was confused, I failed to reply, which caused the Rebbe to prompt, “I didn’t hear your promise!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I finally did promise to do what he requested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satisfied, the Rebbe then said, “I want to prepare you that it will be hard over there. Very hard. And, if for any reason you are unable to put on these &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;, you must still say the &lt;em&gt;Shema&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not understanding any of it, but trusting the Rebbe, I set off. The flight to Korea started in California with stops in Hawaii, Wake Island, and Japan before arriving at the final destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we stopped in Hawaii for refueling and all of us recruits were sitting around waiting to reboard, I decided to stand up and stretch my legs a bit. It proved a momentous decision because just then a colonel I had never seen before came forward, declaring that he had to get on that plane, which meant one of us had to stay behind. Since I was already standing, I was picked. I was not at all happy because this meant I’d be stuck on the tarmac waiting for hours for the next plane out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I eventually arrived and tried to find out how I could rejoin my outfit, I learned that the plane I was supposed to be on was missing. Nobody seemed to know what happened to it, but radio contact with the pilot was lost some time ago. I was in shock, but I realized that, of all the people aboard that plane, I was probably the only one who was still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reassigned to a different group – a bunch of Southerners who didn’t like Jews and they made sure to tell me that, particularly the sergeant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, come morning, I had to put on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; like I promised. I tried to be inconspicuous but, of course, that was impossible. It didn’t go over well with them, and the sergeant made a point of assigning me the worst jobs. He even tried to prevent me from attending a religious retreat to which I was entitled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make that retreat in time, I had to hitch a ride on a two-man plane, which stalled out in mid-air. The pilot was doing his best to restart the engine, and when that failed, he tried to glide the plane into a rice paddy. But just before we hit the ground, the engine caught and we were saved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t make the connection between my rescue with the Rebbe’s &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;, which I was clutching during that terrifying ride. I had them with me because I took them wherever I went, fearing what might happen to them while I was gone. Truth be told though, I had stopped putting them on due to the harassment by the sergeant. Whenever he saw me with them, he would go off his rocker, and he was scaring me. I realized what the Rebbe meant when he said that it was going to become very hard. This was clearly the hard part. (Little did I know that more hard stuff was coming.) Meanwhile, I did what I could – I just said the &lt;em&gt;Shema. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I got a letter from my mother. She wrote, “My dear son Sholom. I just received word from Chabad that the Rebbe said you are not keeping your promise.” I broke out into a cold sweat: How did he know?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that I had to transfer to a different unit, but the only option available was Camp Essayons, which was home to combat engineers who went behind enemy lines to blow up missile sites, bridges and land mines. It was dangerous work but, as far as I was concerned, it was better than suffering in my current unit, where I was afraid to put on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seven months with the combat engineers – just when I thought my tour of duty had ended – President John F. Kennedy extended the service of all troops overseas because of the Cuban Missile Crisis. And this time my unit was sent to the 38&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; parallel, which demarcates the border between North Korea and South Korea – the most dangerous place you could be in that part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we arrived there, we were ordered to dig in, which meant living in a foxhole. The conditions were terrible. It was winter, very cold, with non-stop pouring rain mixed with hail. Our foxhole turned into a mudhole. Meanwhile, heavy artillery kept coming at us from North Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all thought this was the end, and that we had to prepare to meet our Maker. At that moment, the last thing I was thinking of was &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; – I was covered with mud, how could I possibly put them on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one of the soldiers somehow associated these &lt;em&gt;tefillin &lt;/em&gt;with G-d’s protection. He started yelling at me, “We need G-d! Put on those funny boxes and pray!” I objected because of the conditions, but he just went crazy. He shouted, “Either you pray or I will shoot you!” I saw that he was out of his mind with fear and, to calm him down, I agreed to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I took them out, the &lt;em&gt;tefillin &lt;/em&gt;fell down into the mud. They were now soaked with water and caked with mud. But what could I do? I put them on like that and, looking up to the heavens, said the &lt;em&gt;Shema – &lt;/em&gt;“Hear O Israel, the L-rd is our G-d, the L-rd is One.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all of a sudden, the bombing stopped. I had no idea what happened – I felt I was in a twilight zone. As it turned out, the crisis was over. Before long, I was allowed to return home, and I went on with my life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1967, just before the Six Day War, I thought about volunteering for the IDF, but the Rebbe said that I didn’t have to go that far: “Just put on your &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; and tell all your friends to do the same.” At that time, the Rebbe started his &lt;em&gt;tefillin &lt;/em&gt;campaign to get the message out that putting on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; brings down Divine protection. It is also the one thing more than any other that allows a person to get close to G-d. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who has found himself at the epicenter of the greatest nuclear crisis the United States has ever known, I can attest to just how true this is. There is no doubt in my mind that the Rebbe’s&lt;em&gt; tefillin &lt;/em&gt;saved my life many times, and because of the Divine protection they afforded me, I am here to tell the story and to encourage every Jew to put on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;, even if it’s for the first and only time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before retiring, Mr. Shelly Baer owned and operated the Golden Hands Construction company in North Hollywood, California. He was interviewed in January 2019. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Whisper from the Heart</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/654.-Matos-Masei-5785.pdf</link>

      <description>Rabbi Moshe Herson's journey to becoming a Chassid of the Rebbe. The Rebbe whispered 'Gut Yomtov' at the Previous Rebbe's gravesite. Have an image of the Rebbe in your pocket.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a traditional Jewish family, in 1940s Rio de Janeiro. My mother had memories of the &lt;em&gt;shtetl&lt;/em&gt;, of seeing a &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; Rebbe pass by in the street, but my father had little connection to Chasidism. When I was nine, my father passed away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My older brothers never had a formal Jewish education – a tutor came to our house a couple times a week, and that was the extent of it – but my mother decided to take me out of public school and put me in the local Jewish day school, along with my sister. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1949 or so, after I was already Bar Mitzvah, an emissary of the Previous Lubavitcher Rebbe arrived in Brazil, a man by the name of Rabbi Yosef Wineberg, who was also a distant relative. He had come to fundraise, but later we learned that before being sent, the Previous Rebbe had told him: “This is the first time you are going to Brazil. Remember, your purpose there is not only to receive, but also to give.” He was collecting money, but he had to reciprocate too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while in Brazil, Rabbi Wineberg would share words of Torah with the people he met. He came to my school and tested my class, I went to visit him with my brother, and he also paid a visit to our home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the conversation in our home, he asked me whether I might want to learn in a &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; back in New York; he could send me the affidavit I would need for a visa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of course,” I said, out of respect. But in truth, it was the farthest thing from my mind; I wanted to continue my secular studies and eventually become a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True to his word, Rabbi Wineberg sent the papers, but they just sat in our house for nearly a year. When they were about to expire, I had a conversation with my mother. We decided that it would be a good idea to continue my Jewish education in America, before going to university. I had some Brazilian friends who had gone to study in New York’s Torah Vodaas &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt;, but my mother insisted: “You received your papers from Lubavitch, so you will go to Lubavitch,” that is, to the &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; Rabbi Wineberg represented. I remained close with my friends in Torah Vodaas, but once I got to Lubavitch, I was happy there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived when I was fifteen years old, in the summer of 1950, just a few months after the passing of the Previous Rebbe. In Crown Heights at the time, there was a lot of talk about the Previous Rebbe’s younger son-in-law. He was then called the Ramash, but soon, after officially succeeding his father-in-law, he would simply be known as “the Rebbe.” I started observing everything going on, while paying close attention to the Ramash, and I quickly took to him. I'm not sure that I can pinpoint anything specific, but I saw something different in him. He was very genuine, and I found that appealing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long after I arrived was the 12th of Tammuz, anniversary of the Previous Rebbe’s liberation from Soviet prison. In honor of the occasion, we all went to visit his resting place in Queens. Later, it became known as “the Ohel,” but back then, there was only a gravestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days, the Rebbe would travel together with us on the bus to the cemetery. Once we arrived at the Ohel, there weren’t many people standing near the Rebbe, out of respect, but since I didn’t yet know how things worked, I ended up positioning myself right next to him. He was reciting the traditional &lt;em&gt;Maaneh Lashon &lt;/em&gt;prayers, and so was I, and nobody told me to move away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he finished praying, while still holding his prayer book, he looked up at his predecessor’s gravestone and whispered something. I doubt any other bystander could have heard it, but I was standing so close to him that I did: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Gut Yom Tov, Rebbe,&lt;/em&gt;” he said. Then he walked back a few steps and broke down sobbing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scene left a tremendous impression on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months after my arrival, I asked the principal of my &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt;, Rabbi Mendel Tenenbaum, if I could go to speak with the Rebbe. He helped me set up an appointment for a private audience sometime after Simchat Torah. Because the Rebbe had not yet officially assumed the position, this first meetingwas somewhat informal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe listened attentively to my broken Yiddish. The period after my arrival from Brazil was a difficult one for me, and I spoke about some personal things that had been bothering me as I was adjusting to being in &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;so far from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you have a picture of the Rebbe?” he asked at the end of the conversation, referring to the Previous Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I replied that I did, he said, “You should keep the picture with you in your pocket or wallet, and look at it from time to time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to keep a picture of the Previous Rebbe with me, but later, when I became a little wiser, I began carrying an additional picture around – of the Rebbe himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also told me to study one chapter of Psalms a day. “If you need, the &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;can give you a Psalms in Spanish to make it easier,” he offered – my Spanish was better than my Hebrew. “But use whatever means you can to learn a chapter a day.” The language in some chapters is not easy to understand, but I managed to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was, of course, apart from the regular, daily portion of Psalms that we recite as part of a monthly cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, on a separate occasion, the Rebbe gave me an interesting directive regarding my daily studies. This time, it was about the daily Psalms, as well as the daily Tanya, the seminal work of Chabad philosophy that is divided according to an annual study cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had told the Rebbe about some personal matters in a private audience, and then he said to me: “Every day you should recite that day’s portion of Psalms as well as one chapter from tomorrow’s. And study that day’s Tanya, as well as tomorrow’s. And may G-d help you, that you should be today what others are tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Shabbat shortly thereafter, I went to a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen &lt;/em&gt;led by the Rebbe. The Previous Rebbe had told him to lead these &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; gatherings once a month, but back then, before the official succession, there weren’t too many people present. It was just the Rebbe, sitting at the head of two tables that had been put together, a few men seated at the sides, and some &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;students around them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood there, observing the Rebbe, listening, and trying to pick up whatever I could, even though the Hebrew and Aramaic terms he was using, and even some of the Yiddish, were above me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point between talks, to my surprise, the Rebbe turned to me and said, “Maybe Herson can say &lt;em&gt;l’chaim&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody poured me some wine, and I said “&lt;em&gt;L’chaim!” &lt;/em&gt;In that moment, I started to feel a sense of &lt;em&gt;hiskashrus&lt;/em&gt;, that I was connected and had a real relationship with the Rebbe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping a picture of the Rebbe with me – even a mental image – is something that stayed with me after I grew up and became an emissary of his. Several times a day, especially if I’m unsure how to proceed with some problem, I might take a break to think of the Rebbe’s holy image, so that I remember whom I am representing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Moshe Herson was the long-time regional director of Chabad of New Jersey. He was interviewed in May 2008 and November 2016, and passed away earlier this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&quot;HOW TO BE A CAMPUS INFLUENCER&quot;</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/653.-Pinchas-5785.pdf</link>

      <description>One can always positively influence others, despite lack of personal knowledge or experience. A country should not lose focus on what are considered true priorities.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Detroit in a non-observant family. My parents did belong to a Conservative synagogue but they rarely went there, and I’d say our relationship with Judaism was generally on the back-burner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My religious awakening began in 1967. I was 17 at the time, and I was tremendously impressed by Israel’s success in the Six Day War. I was so inspired that I went to our Conservative synagogue, where they had an appeal for Israel, and I pledged $100 (which would be like $1,000 today) in my father’s name. My father did not appreciate my generosity on his behalf and I had to work off some of that pledge myself, but a fire had been lit under me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next year, when I went to college – at Michigan State University in East Lansing – I joined Hillel, the Jewish organization on campus, and for the first time met an Orthodox Jew who loaned me some books on basic Judaism. More importantly, I attended an inspiring lecture by the late Rabbi Dovid Lieberman, a Lubavitcher who later became the chief rabbi of Antwerp, and he suggested I visit the Chabad synagogue, Mishkan Israel, on Nine Mile Road in nearby Oak Park. There, with the help of Rabbi Berel Shemtov, I put on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; for the first time since my Bar Mitzvah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly thereafter, I joined a group of Orthodox students affiliated with Young Israel. We successfully petitioned the university to live together off campus so that we could keep kosher. The large house we rented subsequently became a Chabad House, where we kept a Torah scroll and held prayer services with more than three dozen people attending on Shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1969, I traveled to New York and attended my first &lt;em&gt;farbrengen &lt;/em&gt;where I saw and heard the Rebbe, who made a great impression on me, but I did not meet him in private at that time – I felt I wasn’t ready for such a big step. But by next Passover I was, and it proved a momentous occasion for me. I recall waiting for my turn from about 8 p.m. until about 5 a.m., but meeting the Rebbe was well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea what to expect and I did not know that the custom among &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; is not to sit in the presence of the Rebbe. So, when the Rebbe gestured toward a chair, I sat down. I think he wanted me to feel comfortable, and I did – his smile was so warm and I sensed his goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of our conversation, I explained that I was a university student, and I told him about the Jewish activities I was involved in on campus. The Rebbe seemed to approve and said, “I see that you are in a position to influence people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t understand what he meant. I said, “I can’t influence people, Rebbe. I don’t know anything.” This was absolutely true – at the time I didn’t even know what Shavuot was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Rebbe was not deterred. He suggested that it was not necessary for me to be very knowledgeable to have an influence; I simply needed to find answers to the questions people ask. He even joked that this is what he does. “People ask me questions, and I answer their questions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also told the Rebbe that I didn’t know what direction to take in life. I didn’t know if I should stay in college and get my degree, or if I should drop out and enroll in &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the Rebbe asked me how much more time I had to put in before getting my degree, and I answered that I was half-way through. He said, “In that case, you should finish your university education, but during your summer and winter breaks, you should attend &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that is what I did, and even though the breaks lasted only three weeks each, the religious education I received during that time was very significant and kept my life on the right path. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that audience, the Rebbe also said something that illustrated how well he understood people and human psychology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spoke about how people deceive themselves. He used the example of what was happening in America at the time. This was in the aftermath of the race riots that accompanied the Civil Rights Movement and followed the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, but instead of dealing with these issues, Americans were focused on sending a man to the moon, the Rebbe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People know what they should do,” he said, “but they delude themselves. They distract themselves with things that are not priorities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to apply that to my own life. I remember that I really know what I should be concentrating on, so I can make sure I’m not veering in the direction of what’s easier, away from what’s more important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s how the Rebbe changed my life – one, by advising me that I can always influence people in positive ways; and two, by advising me to recognize what is the real priority for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although fifty years have passed since I met him, the Rebbe’s words of guidance made such an impression on me that they stayed with me all that time, and I hope that they will also similarly impress those who hear them from me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Reuven Meer is an attorney living in Oak Park, Michigan. He was interviewed in August 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Escaping the Heat and Discovering the Warmth</title>

      <description>A description of the Rebbe's visit to Camp Gan Israel in 1960. The visit left a life-long impact on those present.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt; In 1960, when I was eleven, a neighbor told my mother that there was a good summer camp that had opened up a few years earlier, called Camp Gan Israel. It was hot in New York City, and so my mother signed me up and spread the word about where I’d be spending the summer. As a result, a lot of my friends also ended up registering for the camp – ten or fifteen boys from the West Side of Manhattan, including the children of Rabbi Aron Soloveichik, a distinguished rabbi and lecturer, then at Yeshiva University. This was my first exposure to Lubavitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buses to the campsite in Swan Lake, New York, would be leaving from Crown Heights. That day, we took a train into Brooklyn – the first time I was ever there. When we arrived, the first thing that hit me was that I had never seen so many bearded men in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We boarded the buses in front of 770, but they didn’t leave right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s taking so long?” someone called out from the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Maybe they haven’t paid the bus driver!” another voice replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the reason for the delay was something else. The Rebbe was coming out to see us off. I didn’t yet even know who the Rebbe was, but I caught a glimpse of him. Eventually, we left and made it to camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That summer was a very enjoyable one. I liked the excitement, the atmosphere, the songs, the Torah classes – everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Sunday morning, we woke to the news that the Rebbe would be visiting the camp. I didn’t exactly know what this meant, but I realized that it must be something significant, because suddenly the place became spotless. Passover cleaning pales in comparison to the way we cleaned up our bunks; you could eat off the floor. We were all given a special commemorative green &lt;em&gt;yarmulke&lt;/em&gt;, and a picture of the Rebbe was put up in our bunkhouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, the Rebbe arrived at the camp, in a beige Cadillac. He went straight to the bunkhouses to inspect every room, while we stood by our beds. When the Rebbe walked into our room, he smiled at us, and you could see that he was taking everything in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then went to the campsite’s main hall, which was being used as a synagogue. There, the Rebbe held a gathering for us, speaking to us in Yiddish, which I was able to understand a little bit. People had come to see the Rebbe from all over the Catskills, so we were squeezed into that room, with the campers in the middle and &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;students and young men on the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the 200th year since the passing of the Rabbi Yisrael Baal Shem Tov, the founder of the &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; movement, as well as the namesake of Camp Gan Israel. That anniversary was one of the reasons for the Rebbe’s visit. The Rebbe spoke about the Baal Shem Tov, among other things, and told a story about a village boy who came to the Baal Shem Tov’s synagogue on Yom Kippur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this boy had never gone to school or learned anything about Judaism, he had a warm Jewish heart, and so when he saw everyone praying to G-d, he wanted to join in too. He didn’t know how to use a prayerbook, so he decided to express himself in his own way, by mimicking a sound he liked to hear every morning – the cry of a rooster: &lt;em&gt;Cock-a-doodle-do! &lt;/em&gt;Later, the Baal Shem Tov said that because this boy’s simple cry had come from a place of heartfelt love of G-d and awe of His judgment, it had achieved what the prayers of the rest of the congregation could not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;, there was &lt;em&gt;Kos Shel Bracha&lt;/em&gt;, where the Rebbe gave out wine from his cup, along with a blessing. Mrs. Krauss, an older woman who served as the camp nurse, also went over, in her white nurse’s uniform, and the Rebbe gave her a nice blessing too. Everyone also received a pocket-sized “Mincha and Maariv” prayerbook, and we all prayed the afternoon service together with the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the Rebbe went to take a tour of the rest of the campgrounds. He walked very quickly, accompanied by his secretaries. Rabbis Avremel Shemtov and Moshe Lazar, who were the two pillars of the camp, and some other members of the staff also went along. There was a very exciting atmosphere, with people running after the Rebbe, pictures being taken, and even some film, which was rare in those days. The Rebbe took in the whole place, from beginning to end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe asked about adding a basketball court as well as a handball court – of course, a few weeks later, the camp put up both – but he said there was “no need” for a tennis court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an exciting few hours, the Rebbe left and continued to the nearby Camp Emunah girls camp. The whole experience made a tremendous impact on everybody who was there, and especially on me, who had never seen such a thing before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to Camp Gan Israel for the next few summers, and although the Rebbe didn’t come back to visit, he placed a great emphasis on the importance of camp. There were letters and telegrams, and his secretary Rabbi Hodakov used to call the camp on his behalf to make sure that everything was going well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through camp, I got to know more about Lubavitch, its customs, and philosophy. Of course, there were many stories and discussions about the Rebbe and his teachings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that some people would drive into Crown Heights every Shabbat, or whenever the Rebbe was expected to have a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen. &lt;/em&gt;By 1963, when I was fourteen, I very much wanted to attend one of these &lt;em&gt;farbrengens&lt;/em&gt;. Although my father wasn’t in favor of my leaving camp, I was adamant, and so he sent a letter to Rabbi Shemtov giving me permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Shabbat was the 20th of Av, the &lt;em&gt;yahrzeit &lt;/em&gt;of the Rebbe’s father. So, in addition to being at my first &lt;em&gt;farbrengen &lt;/em&gt;in 770 and hearing him recite a &lt;em&gt;chasidic &lt;/em&gt;discourse, I also heard the Rebbe lead all of the prayers that Shabbat. 770 was smaller than it is today, and the place was packed, with people hanging from the sides of the room, and pushing to be able to hear the Rebbe. The scene left a great impact on me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after Shabbat, we went back to camp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I found out that Rabbi Shemtov mentioned to the Rebbe that I had come to this &lt;em&gt;farbrengen.&lt;/em&gt; In reply, the Rebbe wrote a note following up on me: “Was there a continuation?” he asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And indeed there was. After finishing high school, I had my first personal audience with the Rebbe. Shortly afterward, I transferred to the Chabad &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;system in Israel. Over the following years, I attended many more &lt;em&gt;farbrengens &lt;/em&gt;with the Rebbe – first as a student in his &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;at 770, and later as one of his emissaries. And all of this began with just a few summers at camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Telsner served as a Chabad emissary in London for 33 years, working in the field of adult education and as rabbi of the Finchley Central Synagogue. In 2007, he moved to Melbourne, Australia, where he serves as the community &lt;/em&gt;dayan&lt;em&gt;. He was interviewed in June 2014.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LET'S TALK ABOUT TODAY</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/651.-Chukas-5785-1.pdf</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/651.-Chukas-5785-1.pdf</guid>
      <description>The journey from a traditional Jewish upbringing to becoming a full-fledged Chabad Chassid. The relationship between a child and their parents can be maintained despite some differences.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My father was a learned, spiritual Jew, even though he never studied in a &lt;em&gt;yeshivah. &lt;/em&gt;Instead, after fleeing from Czarist Russia just before the Revolution, he went to Fordham University Law School. And while many other Jews in those years gave up on Shabbat, he remained observant, even when it demanded real sacrifice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, he had a trajectory planned out for me. I would go to Williamsburg’s Yeshiva Torah Vodaath through high school, and then stay on afterwards in their &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;program, while attending college in the evenings. Like my father, I was going to become a lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in Williamsburg, my father knew and worked with many &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt;. He also had a special respect for the Lubavitcher &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; – “they’re the ones who go out of their way for others,” he told me – but he didn’t want me to become one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in the early ‘50s, when I was about thirteen, a couple of young &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;students came to visit the bungalow colony where my family was staying for the summer. “These are Lubavitchers,” I was told, “and they spend their vacation selling Jewish books and sharing Judaism with others.” It was the first time that I had witnessed Chabad’s outreach work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At summer camp a couple of years later, I studied some &lt;em&gt;Tanya&lt;/em&gt;, the seminal work of Chabad philosophy, with a different visiting student. The next summer, I went to Chabad’s Camp Gan Israel. In 1955, I began attending a weekly class on &lt;em&gt;Chasidut&lt;/em&gt;, which had a profound influence on me. I also began attending the Rebbe’s &lt;em&gt;farbrengens &lt;/em&gt;regularly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these was on the last day of Passover, 1956. Berel Shemtov, another young &lt;em&gt;chasid,&lt;/em&gt; took me along, together with a colleague of mine from Torah Vodaath, to receive some wine and a blessing from the Rebbe. It was the first time I met the Rebbe, eye to eye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They want to ask for a blessing to become &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt;!” Rabbi Shemtov told the Rebbe, after introducing us. He must have felt that this was what we really wanted, deep down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I agree to the blessing,” replied the Rebbe, “but they have to agree too!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to feel that there was something exciting in Chabad. These people were interested in the broader Jewish community, and there was a depth to them that went to the essence of Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in 12th grade at Torah Vodaath, Gershon Mendel Gorelik, the young man who was teaching our &lt;em&gt;Chasidut&lt;/em&gt; class, suggested that I have a private audience with the Rebbe, so I made an appointment for around February of 1957. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation, I memorized a &lt;em&gt;chasidic &lt;/em&gt;discourse and adopted a few extra &lt;em&gt;chasidic &lt;/em&gt;customs. Then, I wrote all of this in a note that I gave to the Rebbe when I went into his office – along with a few questions about my future studies and my plans to go to college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the audience, the Rebbe instructed me to study &lt;em&gt;Chasidut&lt;/em&gt; every day for at least ten minutes. As for my &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;studies, he encouraged me to remain in Torah Vodaath until the end of that academic year. But then he continued: “If you want my opinion, I think that rather than going to college, you should spend a year devoting all of your energy to Torah subjects – and maybe even longer than that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have followed the Rebbe’s advice and devoted all my time to Torah study in the Torah Vodaath &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt;. But I realized that all of my classmates there would be attending evening college, and I began to think it was time to make the move to Chabad’s Tomchei Temimim &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;network. It wasn’t an easy decision to make. Then someone remarked to me that “sooner or later,” I would come to Tomchei Temimim, but I would probably regret that I hadn’t come sooner&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I decided to write a letter to the Rebbe asking about it, and with his encouragement, I went to the Chabad &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; in Montreal after the Tishrei holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few days before I left for Montreal, at the &lt;em&gt;farbrengen &lt;/em&gt;that Simchat Torah, I went over to the Rebbe with a request: “I want to ask for a blessing that I should succeed in Tomchei Temimim.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe turned to me: “Amen! Amen!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to back away from his table when the Rebbe called after me: “But you also have to do something for this!” In other words, the empowerment you get from above doesn’t absolve you from putting in your own effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father, meanwhile, was displeased with my change of plans. To him, I was just going to be hanging out in a &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;instead of pursuing a career, and although he wasn’t the type to get angry, he was upset with the whole idea. To say that our relationship was strained is an understatement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time I came back home from Montreal, in early 1958, I had another audience with the Rebbe, where I spoke about my family situation. The Rebbe advised me to avoid getting into debates about the issue with my father. “Don’t push him into a corner,” was how he put it. Instead, I should study well in &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt;, and when my father would see that I was succeeding there, the results would bring him around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe also asked whether my father had ever come to a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen &lt;/em&gt;in 770. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hadn’t. “I tried to get him to come talk with the Rebbe, but he declined,” I offered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Asking him to come and talk with someone he has never met before might be too much,” the Rebbe said. The open atmosphere of a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen, &lt;/em&gt;however, with the diverse crowd of people in attendance – “Jews with beards, and without beards,” as he described it – might be more inviting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Rebbe’s suggestion, I had someone who was close with my parents invite my father to come to the next big &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;, which was that Purim, and even to drive him there and back. The Purim &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt; of 1958 ended up being a special event and a very positive experience for my father. When I saw the Rebbe a month after that, at the &lt;em&gt;Kos Shel Bracha &lt;/em&gt;ceremony at the end of Passover, he asked about my father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It got a little better,” I reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will become completely better!” predicted the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the four years I ended up spending in Montreal, until the summer of 1961, that was exactly what happened. My relationship with my father thawed, and in 1962, just a few days before my wedding – which the Rebbe was going to officiate – my parents went to meet him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened the door as they went into the Rebbe’s room, and introduced them: “These are my parents.” Before I closed the door and left, I saw the Rebbe jump up and walk around his desk to greet them and shake my father’s hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I heard what happened. My father, a man of deep integrity, felt uncomfortable with the Rebbe’s friendly gesture. Given his early opposition, he felt that it was undeserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have to tell you,” he confessed, “when my son went to your &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt;, I wasn’t very happy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But what do you say today?” asked the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today I’m happy,” answered my father. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then let’s talk about today.” Let’s focus on the positive, the Rebbe was saying, and build on that. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The journey of young man getting pulled into the world of Lubavitch. The Rebbe's advice to a Baal Teshuvah on how to handle his relationship with secular parents.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Venice Beach, Los Angeles, in a traditional Jewish family. My parents were both Holocaust survivors who came from religious homes in Russia, but who led a less observant life in America. I guess it was the West Coast influence. I myself was a happy go-lucky young man who enjoyed surfing and sports and all that life near the Pacific Ocean had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two years of college, which I did not enjoy, I decided – in the summer of 1968 – to drive across the country, camping on the way to save money. After that, I was going to travel on to Russia and end up in Israel. That was my plan, but an encounter with the Rebbe changed all that – it changed me and the course of my life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As funny as it may sound, that turn of events was set in motion because I had to use the bathroom. Towards the end of my cross-country journey, I had arrived in Brooklyn and, looking around, I saw a building adorned with the Star of David, which I assumed must be a synagogue. I figured they wouldn’t mind me using their bathroom and so I walked in. Nobody bothered me, but as I was leaving, a very nice fellow came up to me and asked who I was. After I told him my story and that I was on my way to Russia and Israel, he invited me to join the afternoon prayers. I accepted his offer; afterwards, he said to me, “You’ve got to meet the Rebbe.” I had no idea who he was talking about, but I had time and I enjoyed meeting new people, so I said, “Okay, let’s go check him out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked across the street – Eastern Parkway – and into a building that turned out to be the Chabad Headquarters, 770. Over there, everybody had big beards like the hippies in LA, and they were very friendly to me. I felt comfortable with them; they seemed like my kind of people. After a while, they said that the Rebbe was about to pray – I guess it was the evening prayer – and that I should join. I hadn’t prayed for most of my life and here I was about to pray for a second time in one day! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went upstairs to a room where I saw this beautiful man surrounded by his &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt;. I sensed that he was a wise man, a sage, and I felt a closeness, a connection. When the service was over, and he was passing by me, I gave him the “peace sign,” and he responded with a warm smile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s how I first met the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next thing you know, one of the nice fellows from 770 put me up for the night – which I really appreciated, as I had been sleeping outdoors all the way across the country and it was nice to sleep in a bed for a change – and then he invited me to a party. I was very happy to go. I imagined rock music, girls, dancing, and so I was very surprised to be ushered into a hall set up with bleachers all around on which sat what seemed like a thousand guys. This was a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;, my first. They sang soulful &lt;em&gt;niggunim&lt;/em&gt;, and the Rebbe spoke at length, and I enjoyed the experience very much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next invitation I got was to join in some Torah learning, and that’s how I ended up in a Chabad &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; for beginners – Hadar HaTorah. The teaching spoke to me, and the warmth and friendliness made it even more enjoyable, though there were challenges to be sure. Going from a free-wheeling lifestyle to one governed by strict religious rules was not easy. But it was deeply meaningful, and it made me forget my travel plans altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The months flew by, and Passover approached. The &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; was closing, as most guys would be leaving to spend the holiday with their families. I was concerned about returning to California, since I had been keeping Torah all this time and I wasn’t sure how I would be able to do that in my parents’ non-observant home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happened, my birthday was coming up, and in keeping with the &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; tradition, I was granted a private audience with the Rebbe for the occasion. I took the opportunity to ask the Rebbe: “Is going home the right thing for me to do? Will I be okay there?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In answer to my question, the Rebbe said that I needed to find out whether, in the vicinity of my parents’ home, there were Chabad rabbis who would help me keep Passover “the way it is supposed to be kept,” like I had learned in the &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt;. If so, then I should go home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find that out, the Rebbe recommended three avenues – making a long-distance call to my parents, or sending them a telegram via Western Union, or sending them something called an AirGram, which was a letter by special delivery. I know this sounds strange today, but I am talking about 1969 – before there was a Chabad House in every neighborhood, and before there were cellphones and the internet. Back then, a phone call from New York to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California was considered long-distance and cost something like $3 for just five minutes (that’s $25 in today’s dollars)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After receiving his blessings for success, I walked out. It must have been about two in the morning, but I decided to act immediately on the Rebbe’s advice. Across the street, there was a payphone, and although I wasn’t sure I had enough change for the call, I decided to give it a try. I picked up the receiver and even before I put any coins into the slot, I heard a man saying, “Hello, hello, hello!” I asked, “Who is this?” The man answered, “This is Rabbi Shlomo Cunin from Los Angeles. I’m trying to reach 770.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My knees almost buckled. I simply couldn’t believe it. This was the very person who could help me with my visit to my parents!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Man, do I have to talk to you!” I said, and I told him what had just transpired with the Rebbe. Rabbi Cunin had recently opened the first Chabad House, at the University of California in Los Angeles, and he immediately offered to do whatever was necessary. And he did. He came over with a couple of guys to my parents’ house and they made their kitchen kosher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything turned out just how it was supposed to. The Rebbe’s advice was that I make the effort – make a long-distance call, or send a telegram, or send an AirGram. I chose the first option and everything went forward so smoothly it was almost miraculous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was time for Sukkot, I faced the same problem. Should I go home? My parents never had a &lt;em&gt;sukkah &lt;/em&gt;but I wanted to help them build one&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;So I went to see the Rebbe again, and he gave me a blessing that I should be successful in building a proper &lt;em&gt;sukkah &lt;/em&gt;in LA. And he added, “Make sure you get the &lt;em&gt;daled minim&lt;/em&gt;,” meaning the four species – the palm frond, the willow, the myrtle and the citron – which are used for the &lt;em&gt;mitzvah &lt;/em&gt;of the holiday. “Go home and it will be nice.” And it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that I was very blessed to have encountered the Rebbe. What would have happened to me if, instead, I had followed through with my plan and traveled to Soviet Russia? I shudder to think. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am beyond grateful that I met him, and that he and his &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; helped me turn my life in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RAISING FOUR CHILDREN ON ONE DOLLAR</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/649.-Shelach-5785-Email.pdf</link>

      <description>Dr. Anne Lewinsky and her husband Sid, who were struggling to conceive, received the Rebbe's blessing to have children. In addition to adopting, they merited a child of their own.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When I was a nineteen-year-old medical student, in 1973, I married my husband Sid. But three years later, when I was beginning my medical internship, I still hadn’t gotten pregnant. Many of our friends already had children, and I began to get distressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of the other medical interns I was working with, Fiona Messel and Rodney Undertslak, happened to be religious Jews, and they recommended that we go to see Rabbi Mendel and Mashi Lipskar, who were the Chabad emissaries in South Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Speak to them about getting a blessing for children,” they suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Lipskars’ encouragement, we began observing the laws of family purity. In 1979, around Passover time, we also started keeping kosher. We had the &lt;em&gt;mezuzot&lt;/em&gt; in our homechecked by a scribe, to ensure they were in good condition. We also put up more &lt;em&gt;mezuzot&lt;/em&gt;, so that every single door in our house that required one had a &lt;em&gt;mezuzah&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same year, with the help of Rabbi Sydney Katz, our community rabbi in Pretoria, we began preparing to go to New York to see the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Katz was a good friend of Rabbi Yosef Wineberg, who was an important person in the Chabad community, so accommodations were arranged for us to stay with the Winebergs over Shavuot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Sid, who had gone to a Jewish day school, I hadn’t grown up in a particularly religious home, so it was all very dramatic for me. I’d never even been in a synagogue with such a stringent separation between women and men, and being surrounded by so many orthodox women– and babies, and more babies – was quite confronting for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Freidy Wineberg, the daughter of our hosts, really helped me. She took a shine to me, and I to her. We went to synagogue together, sitting in the front row so that I could actually see what was going on, and Freidy explained the service to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Rabbi Wineberg took Sid under his wing, and they sat just two or three meters away from the Rebbe for the services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the second day of Shavuot, there was a public gathering led by the Rebbe, followed by another event at the conclusion of the holiday, where the Rebbe gave people wine from his cup. Several times, as the Rebbe looked around the synagogue, he gazed right in our direction, and he often looked at Sid as well. It was all a wonderful experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our personal audience with the Rebbe was after the holiday. Rabbi Wineberg took us to 770 fairly late at night, around 10:00 PM or so, and when we arrived, there was a queue of people. After some time waiting outside the Rebbe’s office, we were eventually called in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Welcome to America,” the Rebbe greeted us, offering us seats across his desk. “Where are you coming from? Did you enjoy the services?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was already the third or fourth time that we had seen the Rebbe, but now he was directly in front of us, and the aura around him was phenomenal.I remember watching the Rebbe and his incredible eyes as he was speaking to Sid, and feeling that I was in the presence of Moses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole audience was only about three minutes in total. The Rebbe asked if we had checked our &lt;em&gt;mezuzot, &lt;/em&gt;and also encouraged us to continue observing Shabbat, as well as with keeping the laws of family purity and kosher. “Please observe kosher,” he said, “and bring your children up with it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had just turned kosher that Passover, less than two months before, and to be honest it was very difficult for me. The fact that my mother couldn’t make me a cake, or that my sisters couldn’t bring me a salad, was quite alienating. Nevertheless, we were able to tell the Rebbe that we were keeping kosher and that we had just put up &lt;em&gt;mezuzot&lt;/em&gt; on every door of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, he asked why we had come. We explained that we had been married for over six years, and were hoping for a blessing for children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe looked at us and said, “You will be blessed with children, and you will see them to the &lt;em&gt;chupah&lt;/em&gt;” – that is, you will merit to see them marry according to Jewish tradition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then leaned over the table and gave us each a dollar, which Rabbi Wineberg later explained were ours to keep; we’d give another dollar to charity in exchange. I’ve actually kept that dollar in my purse for all these years. We left feeling elated and inspired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when we got back home, I didn’t become pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next year, we began thinking that it might be time to adopt: &lt;em&gt;Maybe that is how we will be blessed.&lt;/em&gt; So, being the doctor I am, I got on the phone, calling every other doctor I could and asking if they knew of any babies up for adoption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Rabbi Katz helped us with preparing the paperwork for the courts and for a house visit with the social workers, so that by the time we got a phone call on the 3rd of November, 1980, everything was ready. We were able to see our son Dan from the minute he was born, and then just a few days later, on my secular birthday, we brought our little boy home – thank G-d. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, just 18 days later, I got a phone call from one of the other doctors I’d spoken to. There was another woman he had in mind for us, in Johannesburg, and she had just gone into labor. Suddenly we were blessed with this instant family – a boy and a girl – and it was marvelous. Three rabbis oversaw their conversions, and for us, this was the Rebbe’s blessing being fulfilled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years later, I got a call from my gynecologist, who had a young pregnant patient who wanted to give up her baby. “You and Sid are the only people I could think of,” he explained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was how our daughter Robyn joined our family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for all this time, we had never understood why I couldn’t have biological children; there was no medical reason for it at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, not long after I had gone to see my doctor about a related medical issue, I suddenly discovered that I was pregnant. Eighteen years after we got married, I gave birth to our son Kevin. Our older children chose that name for him, but he also has a Hebrew name – Menachem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Rebbe’s blessing really came to pass when all of our children went on to marry Jewish spouses. Today, in addition to our children, we are blessed with eight grandchildren, and I believe the Rebbe’s blessing will carry on, from us to our children, to their children, and please G-d, to their children’s children, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Anne Lewinsky resides in Sydney, Australia, where she practices general medicine with a focus on nutrition and diet, together with her husband, Sid, a retired asset manager. They were both interviewed in August 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CAN KIDS LIKE SCHOOL?</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/648.-Behaaloscha-5785.pdf</link>

      <description>Sara Pinson, a young girl, struggled to adjust to a Chabad high school. The Rebbe not only helped her persevere but also gave her a life mission to ensure children love school, which she fulfilled by running a successful school herself.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1968, the only Jewish girls’ high school in the Bronx closed. My parents, Rabbi Mordechai and Rachel Altein, who served as Chabad emissaries there since the 1940s, decided that my sister and I would attend the Chabad high school for girls, Beth Rivkah, and board with our grandparents in Crown Heights. To say the least, this option was definitely not my choice, but that is what we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of difficulty adjusting to a big boisterous school. It was hard to make friends, hard to “belong,” and hard to get used to the students’ behavior, which was very different from what I was accustomed to. I called home often to complain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of tenth grade, I had had enough and was determined to leave. My father decided to take me with him for a private audience with the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe advised that I should not quit something in the middle and that I should stay in Beth Rivkah until the end of high school. I replied that I did not want to do that. But the Rebbe said that while he understood that I did not want to do it, that was what I had to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I realize that the Rebbe was giving me two very important life lessons: When you start something, you have to see it through to the end. You have to finish and honor your commitment. Secondly, we do not always want to do what has to be done, but that is not a reason not to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got into twelfth grade, I was convinced that soon I would be out of my misery. I had many ideas of what I wanted to do next, including college, and any seminary besides Beth Rivkah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to write to the Rebbe, as my father had always told me to do, as a best friend and as a loving father. But the Rebbe did not answer my very long letter, in which I had literally poured out my heart and shared my dreams for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months later, our whole family was arriving at 770 for a private audience with the Rebbe in honor of my brother’s Bar Mitzvah. When the Rebbe’s secretary, Rabbi Leibel Groner saw me, he asked me to come into the office, because he had an answer for me from the Rebbe. By then, so much time had passed that I had almost forgotten that I had written that letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my very great surprise, and to the surprise of my father, the Rebbe’s handwritten answer was several paragraphs long. For a young girl who was just turning seventeen, this was an unusually long response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After describing why college would not be a suitable option for me, he explained that since I was the one who had experienced all the shortcomings in the school system that I had mentioned in my letter, it was my special mission to correct them. I needed to find the solution and to make sure that children would love school. And this, he wrote, should be done by first acquiring the necessary knowledge and expertise, by being determined, and by not being deterred by cynics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter concludes with the Rebbe’s blessings for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, I was no longer a miserable victim who was suffering, but a person with a mission. If I perceived that something was wrong, that meant that G-d was telling me that I was the one who could do something about it. Needless to say, I stayed on in Beth Rivkah, completing my studies in the teachers’ seminary. And the message of that letter accompanies me every day of my life, empowering me whenever I am faced with challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, I put this guidance into practice with the school that I run with my husband. With nearly 400 students, it is vibrant, full of fresh ideas and exciting projects, and highly reputed in France. We try to create a living Jewish experience for our students, most of whom do not come from religious homes, with a high standard of learning. But to us, the important thing is that they come to school each morning with joy and love – because they want to come. This is the mission that the Rebbe set for me: You hated school, so go see to it that children should be happy in school. That’s your job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following is an excerpt from the Rebbe’s letter to Mrs. Pinson. The full text can be found in its original Hebrew in Igrot Kodesh vol. 27 p. 524&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is certainly reasonable (and normal) for a young person to have a thirst for finding a challenge, something new, etc…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;em&gt;ready&lt;/em&gt; challenge for Jewish girls who are like you, which &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be overcome. Namely, the shortcomings you mentioned in the atmosphere of the seminaries (and schools in general) which &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be fixed, but only by those who have &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt; felt and encountered them. However, like any good objective, it requires self-preparation, and to the point of exerting great &lt;em&gt;effort&lt;/em&gt;. More specifically: to acquire sufficient knowledge in the subjects that are studied in seminaries, pedagogical expertise, and the firm decision not to be deterred if you don’t experience immediate results, nor to be swayed by naysayers. And after that, to start to change the atmosphere, etc., with enthusiasm and dedication. And G-d Almighty will, no doubt, grant you success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a Chabad emissary in Nice, France, Mrs. Sara Pinson is the principal of the local Kerem Menachem school. She was interviewed in March 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MORE IMPORTANT THAN EATING</title>

      <description>The Rebbe's campaign for all Jewish men and boys to wear Rabbeinu Tam's tefillin in addition to Rashi's, citing the need for extra divine protection in challenging times.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The highlight of any young man’s life is, of course, his Bar Mitzvah. And for Lubavitch families in the sixties this also meant the opportunity to have a personal audience with the Rebbe. Additionally, there was a custom in those days, at the public &lt;em&gt;farbrengen &lt;/em&gt;preceding the occasion, for the Bar Mitzvah boy to go over to the Rebbe with his father and receive a special blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father, Rabbi J.J. Hecht, a devoted communal activist who worked for the Rebbe on a number of causes, was making a trip to Israel right before my Bar Mitzvah in 1967 – which happened to be just a few weeks before the Six Day War. When we approached the Rebbe at the preceding &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;, the Rebbe gave my father a bottle of spirits. “Since you are traveling to the Land of Israel,” the Rebbe told him, “I want you to spend Shabbat in Jerusalem and to lead the &lt;em&gt;farbrengen &lt;/em&gt;there.” Before the Six Day War, Jerusalem was only partly under Jewish control, but the Rebbe wanted my father to bring this bottle there, to speak with the local &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; and to inspire them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, quoting a line from the Passover Haggadah, the Rebbe added a word of warning about the crowd my father would be facing: “But remember that over there, they fulfill the words ‘we are all wise, we are all understanding, we are all knowledgeable’…” The &lt;em&gt;chasidim &lt;/em&gt;in Israel, in other words, had heard it all before, so inspiring them might prove to be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon my father’s return, we were hoping to have a private audience with the Rebbe, but there was a problem. It was a Thursday, when the Rebbe would usually meet with people in the evenings, but because he was fasting – the Rebbe observed a series of fasts after every Passover and Sukkot – there weren’t going to be any audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, my father had some pull, and so he wrote a note to the Rebbe: “My son would very much like to have an audience before his Bar Mitzvah.” We were soon told that we could come to see the Rebbe before the evening service, but just me and my parents, so that it would be “without a commotion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Bar Mitzvah boys traditionally deliver an in-depth discussion of some Talmudic issue, or a pilpul, at the celebration. And so, after we entered the Rebbe’s room together, the Rebbe asked me a few questions on my &lt;em&gt;pilpul. &lt;/em&gt;Studying wasn’t my number one forte, but I had prepared well and had a good understanding of my subject, which was the various opinions on how the scriptural passages inside the &lt;em&gt;tefillin &lt;/em&gt;are to be arranged. There is the pair of &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; that all Jewish men put on, which follows the opinion of the sage Rashi, but then there are also versions that follow the views of Rabbeinu Tam, the Shimushah Rabbah, and Raavad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe asked me to explain the differences between these opinions&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and I was able to answer him clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After giving me a blessing, he asked, “And what is the outcome of your &lt;em&gt;pilpul&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A G-d-fearing Jew must use two pairs of &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;,” I replied. As I had learned, although it is rare for anyone to follow the opinion of the latter two Halachic authorities, someone who is considered pious is supposed to put on Rabbeinu Tam’s &lt;em&gt;tefillin, &lt;/em&gt;in addition to Rashi’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And what about you?” asked the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those days, the Chabad custom was to not wear Rebbeinu Tam’s before the age of eighteen; Bar Mitzvah boys only had Rashi’s. But how did that connect with the conclusion of my &lt;em&gt;pilpul&lt;/em&gt;? I knew that “Well, I guess I don’t have the proper fear of G-d,” was the wrong thing to say, but I also wasn’t about to start putting on Rebbeinu Tam’s &lt;em&gt;tefillin. &lt;/em&gt;I was quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe gave a broad smile. “You will probably do what your father did at his Bar Mitzvah.” In other words, I didn’t have to start yet, because my father hadn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I left the room, so that my parents could speak with the Rebbe privately. But later, in the car ride home, I heard what happened next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I left, the Rebbe first turned to my father, and remarked, “There are distinguished rabbis who come here and can’t describe the different arrangements of the four pairs of &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;!” I’m not going to say that the Rebbe was impressed, but he was very happy that I was able to explain the matter with clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion then turned to my father’s trip. My father had brought the bottle of spirits to the Chabad synagogue in Jerusalem, as the Rebbe had instructed. During the little gathering that followed the prayers on Shabbat, he got up to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Rebbe warned me about you guys,” he said. “But he also knows that I’m a pulpit rabbi, and an orator, and he wanted me to give a speech. So let me tell you this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the Rebbe has a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;, all the &lt;em&gt;chasidim &lt;/em&gt;are there. When he leads the prayers, everyone is pushing to get close. But when the Rebbe asks us to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; something, who shows up? Where are we?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Did you see how happy the Rebbe was when I told him how I spoke?” my father asked my mother on the way home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as they continued to discuss the trip, with the Rebbe asking for details about everything my father had seen in Israel, the Rebbe’s secretary began to get concerned. It was already time for the evening service, after which the Rebbe would conclude his fast, but my father was still talking to the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, he opened the door, and started to say: “The Rebbe is fasting – please leave the room now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Rebbe told him to wait. “The report Rabbi Hecht is giving is more important than eating.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Rebbe launched a &lt;em&gt;tefillin &lt;/em&gt;campaign for Israel the next week, and then war broke out two days after that, we had an extra appreciation for the Rebbe’s heightened interest in what was going on in the country at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost a decade later, in 1976, the Rebbe announced that everyone should be putting on Rabbeinu Tam’s &lt;em&gt;tefillin &lt;/em&gt;in addition to Rashi’s, including younger boys. Citing the Talmud, he explained that wearing &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; summons divine protection for the Jewish people against its enemies. As the “darkness of exile has grown,” as he put it, so are those who intend us harm stronger, but it is “G-d who saves us from their hand.” Therefore, we must observe the &lt;em&gt;mitzvah&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; – with greater power, “both according to Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that private audience all those years before, the Rebbe had implied that if not for the prevailing custom, Bar Mitzvah boys should be putting on Rabbeinu Tam’s as well. Now, he explicitly said that they shouldn’t wait until they were older. But what about tradition? The Rebbe explained that previous generations did not face the same challenges as we do today, especially when it comes to being exposed to ideas and ideologies that are foreign to the Torah. Since &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; helps one “submit his heart and mind to the service of G-d” the added holiness of donning another pair of tefillin can help a person meet these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back to my Bar Mitzvah audience, and the Rebbe’s words to me, I understood: Rabbeinu Tam’s &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; are like vitamins for having the proper fear of Heaven, so the Rebbe wants young boys to have them too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An author, speaker, and communal activist, Rabbi Shea Hecht is the chairman of NCFJE, the parent organization of Jewish Released Time. He was interviewed in the years 2015, 2020, and 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Dr. Moshe Feldman recounts his experiences treating the Rebbe for a heart attack in 1977 and a stroke in 1992. The Rebbe's emphasis on joy and unity was clearly evident.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When I was a young boy, Crown Heights was filled with all kinds of Jews. So even though I lived just a few blocks away from 770, I didn’t know much about Lubavitch or the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While attending medical school in Nashville, Tennessee, I met Rabbi Zalman Posner, the Chabad rabbi of the local Orthodox synagogue. He was the first rabbi I ever saw who would handle the questions people had about science and religion, the authenticity of Torah, our purpose in life, and so forth. In his speeches, he would also mention this rabbi in a “little building in Brooklyn” – the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so in 1970, when I moved back to New York with my family after finishing my military service – I was a physician and captain in the Air Force – Lubavitch was the Jewish group whose school we felt comfortable sending our children to. I was at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, first finishing my residency training and then studying pediatric cardiology, and so we sent our children to the nearby &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;run by Rabbi Mordechai Altein. We also hosted Torah classes in our home, made friends in the world of Lubavitch, and I even attended some of the Rebbe’s &lt;em&gt;farbrengens&lt;/em&gt;. However, the first time I actually met him was in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the night of Shemini Atzeret, and our family was spending the holidays in Crown Heights for the first time. The synagogue was very crowded, and I was standing in the back, when suddenly there was screaming: “Everyone out! The Rebbe needs air!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took my children out, but realizing that the Rebbe was suffering a medical emergency, I headed back in. In those days, I was spending more time in intensive care units than at home, and I took my medical equipment everywhere; I was always prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to help, but the &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; weren’t allowing anyone near the Rebbe. Eventually, some people recognized me, and they let me through. By then, he was in his office, and I saw that he was pale and short of breath. The ten or twelve other physicians who were already there agreed that he had the symptoms of a heart attack. However, the Rebbe refused to go to a hospital for more intensive medical care, so most of the physicians left, aside from myself and three others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, when I was alone with the Rebbe, I also tried to convince him. “We have a lot of cardiac equipment here,” I explained, “but it would be better to have a full staff and more extensive equipment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pointed at his desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you see this desk?” he asked me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He pointed around the room. “Do you see my chair? Do you see these books? This desk, this chair, and these books have witnessed the tears of my &lt;em&gt;chasidim &lt;/em&gt;and absorbed their energy. This is the energy that is going to get me better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t argue with that. There was no further discussion about going to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Dr. Bob Richter was able to secure a cardiac monitor and, after hooking it up, we decided to take shifts watching it outside the Rebbe’s room. At around 1:00 AM, we saw the Rebbe’s cardiac rhythm develop a bizarre pattern, which was very ominous. The Rebbe was having another cardiac event at that moment. It confirmed our original diagnosis, and this was when we started caring for the cardiac problem with some intravenous solutions and other medications I had prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the next day, the Rebbe was recovering remarkably well, in terms of his energy. And the night after that, when Simchat Torah was over, he wanted to address his &lt;em&gt;chasidim. &lt;/em&gt;All of the physicians tried to counsel the Rebbe not to do this, feeling that it would be too much strain on his heart, but he insisted. He spoke into a microphone in his office, while sitting up, with speakers set up in the synagogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, four or five of us gathered around the cardiac monitor, ready to jump in if needed. But, by some miracle, when he began speaking, we saw the cardiac pattern return to baseline, to what it would have been before the heart attack. I don’t have a medical explanation for it; it was as though the extra strain, rather than making his heart more abnormal, had returned it to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after the Rebbe resumed his public appearances in the ensuing months, Dr. Levi Lehv and I continued observing him, alongside a team of other doctors, using a telephonic cardiac monitor during public &lt;em&gt;farbrengens&lt;/em&gt;; we were actually the first doctors in New York to use this technology. While Dr. Lehv watched the monitor, I would sit near the Rebbe, watching as he spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was theoretically in fine health by this stage, but I noticed that when he was saying a &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; discourse, in particular, he almost looked like he was no longer physically in the world. It’s hard to explain, but his face was pale, his expression was distant, and if anyone else had presented that way I would think that they were very sick. I called Dr. Lehv on our intercom system, and he told me that everything was fine. There were some things, I learned, that went above what we could see medically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the night of the heart attack, I recall how, for the first few hours, everyone was gathered outside of 770, concerned and waiting to hear word about the Rebbe. At the same time, I also saw some people – fathers with their children, and others – who were still dancing and singing, continuing the traditional &lt;em&gt;hakafot &lt;/em&gt;services, and keeping up the energy of the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, when I was back in the Rebbe’s office, he asked me how things were going. I understood that he wasn’t asking about his own physical status; he probably knew more about his cardiac condition than I did. I told him how there were still people singing and dancing in the streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy with that answer, the Rebbe looked at me, smiled, and nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued to help with the Rebbe’s medical needs in the years that followed, including in 1992, when he suffered a stroke while praying at the resting place of the Previous Rebbe. As with any stroke, it took several hours for the signs and symptoms to become manifest in his speech and physical movements, after which it became difficult to understand what he was saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he was first brought back to 770, accompanied by his secretaries, I walked over to him. He looked up at me and said, quite clearly, “&lt;em&gt;Shira v’zimrah&lt;/em&gt;,” which are both Hebrew words for “singing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed out of context; at first I thought I hadn’t heard correctly, and some of the people offered other ideas for what he might have meant. But the Rebbe shook his head, repeated the phrase, and kept looking at me while he said it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I was reminded of how he had smiled when I told him about those &lt;em&gt;chasidim &lt;/em&gt;dancing and singing in the streets fifteen years earlier. There are thousands of articles on the impact of happiness on one’s health, and really everything works better when we have unity and joy. And so I understood that he wanted the same thing once again: To help him with our happiness and our singing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Moshe Feldman was a pediatric specialist who practiced medicine for nearly 50 years – in the Bronx, and later in Crown Heights – until his passing in 2021. He was interviewed in January 2012.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>VANDALISM CHANGES EVERYTHING</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/645.-Behar-Bechukosai-5785.pdf</link>

      <description>After a Torah scroll was vandalized in a Jerusalem Chabad synagogue, the Rebbe guided efforts to rebuild the community with more prayer, learning, and charity. The synagogue grew stronger and more vibrant as a result.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 1979, a couple of years after my wife and I got married, the Rebbe directed us to move to Jerusalem, where I was born, and where my parents still lived. He encouraged me to join my father’s accounting business, and a few months later I also began teaching &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; thought in Toras Emes &lt;em&gt;yeshivah,&lt;/em&gt; in the Chabad neighborhood of Jerusalem. The next year, we moved to the neighborhood of Givat Shaul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1985 we found that there was an old synagogue in the area that hadn’t seen a &lt;em&gt;minyan&lt;/em&gt; for some three years and was now empty and locked. Together with some other young men in the area, we reopened the synagogue. We got the keys, cleaned it up, brought a Torah scroll and started regular services. Eventually it became “Merkaz Shneor,” the local Chabad synagogue for Givat Shaul and nearby Har Nof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe encouraged us quite a lot when I reported on all of this, and quite presciently: Almost as soon as we started, some thirty families moved into the neighborhood. Most had come from English-speaking countries and found themselves lost in Jerusalem. With classes and speeches offered in English as well as Hebrew, our synagogue was a lifesaver for them, and so our community grew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following summer, a local volunteer came to the synagogue together with his son. It was a Thursday afternoon and they were going to set up for Shabbat, but to their surprise, the door was wide open. Inside, they found a scene of destruction: Holy books thrown all over, the curtain of the Ark ripped, and a torn Torah scroll lying on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we later learned from the police investigation, a young Arab man had broken in, apparently looking for money. Once he didn’t find any in the charity boxes, however, he decided to destroy whatever he could. He broke into the Ark, removed the Torah scroll and cut it with a knife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volunteer called me right away, and I called the authorities. The police came immediately, as did Mayor Teddy Kollek, and after him the city’s chief rabbi, Rabbi Yitzchak Kulitz. They wanted to see the disaster for themselves. All were shocked by what they saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t worry about the Torah scroll,” Mayor Kollek told me. “You find a new one, and I’ll pay for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we finished with the police, I went home, called the Rebbe’s secretaries and told them what had happened. The Rebbe was on his way to pray at the resting place of the Previous Rebbe and he only received the message when he returned late that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then it was 5:00 AM in Israel, which was when I got a call from one of the secretaries with a list of instructions, which I immediately wrote down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, on the day of the traditional burial service held for the sections of the Torah scroll that had been damaged, in addition to rewriting the destroyed columns, we were to start writing a new scroll in the synagogue. If the scribe could begin writing the scroll “right next to the Ark, all the better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, for at least the next thirty days, during school hours, a group of children should be brought into the synagogue, to study Torah there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, although we had only held weekday services twice a week, the Rebbe now asked us to start having a &lt;em&gt;minyan &lt;/em&gt;at least once a day, until after the upcoming Tishrei holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, we should acquire more holy books, “a greater number than the books lost in the incident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth and sixth were to bring in more charity boxes, as well as to found a new charitable free-loan society in the synagogue. “And ideally,” he wrote, “the first loan should be given that very day.” We first assumed that this meant the day of the Torah’s funeral, but then someone suggested that it meant the day we received this message. We immediately got someone to give a donation, and then someone else took out a loan, and so about five minutes before Shabbat, I was able to call the Rebbe’s office and let them know that we did this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventh, for Shabbat the next day, the Rebbe asked for representatives from other synagogues in Jerusalem to join us for services. Eighth and ninth, he called for there to be extra Torah classes that Shabbat, and more &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; teachings delivered at the third meal at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tenth and last instruction was interesting. “I hope – based on the teaching of our Sages that ‘one who works hard will succeed’ – that you will find someone who is celebrating a &lt;em&gt;brit &lt;/em&gt;on this Shabbat, and convince him to have it in the synagogue, with the synagogue participating in the expenses of the feast.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the Rebbe pointed out that the damaged Torah scroll should be handled in accordance with Jewish law and Jerusalem custom, and that we should consult the local rabbis in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also offered to pay for any outstanding expenses we would incur. Later that year, however, when I was in New York, I told him that my family had covered all the expenses ourselves, to which he responded with his blessings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He concluded the message with a prayer that G-d “fill the breaches” of Jerusalem, and “may our eyes soon behold Your return to Zion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an address on that first Shabbat, the Rebbe spoke of “something negative that occurred at a synagogue,” even though most people in New York didn’t even know what he was referring to. He added that steps had already been taken, in the “three areas of Torah, prayer, and charity, to remedy the matter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief Sephardic rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu, who lived about ten minutes away, joined us for the services on Friday night, as well as on Shabbat morning, when he gave a big speech. Others came to join us from all over Israel. At the funeral, there were over ten thousand people, including Israel’s two chief rabbis, Rabbi Avraham Shapiro and Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu, the chief rabbis of Jerusalem, Rabbi Yitzchak Kulitz and Rabbi Shalom Mashash, along with members of Knesset and the future Rebbe of Ger, Rabbi Pinchas Menachem Alter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was all finished, I faxed a report to the Rebbe, and half an hour later, I got a call. “The Rebbe received your report,” the secretary told me, “and now he wants there to be an elevation in the synagogue – spiritually and physically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Spiritually I understand, but what does a physical elevation mean?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He checked, and the Rebbe clarified that he was referring to any renovations the synagogue might need. So we managed to create a new women’s gallery by knocking down a wall in the synagogue. We introduced Torah classes for every night of the week and an adult study program for English speakers. The synagogue became a source of Torah learning for every kind of Jerusalemite: Not just for Chabad, but for people from other &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; and non-&lt;em&gt;chasidic &lt;/em&gt;backgrounds, for the religious as well as the non-religious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe’s point was that immediately after this destruction, we needed to do something constructive; the descent should result in an ascent, as the &lt;em&gt;chasidic &lt;/em&gt;expression goes. And indeed, our community has grown tremendously over the years, and it continues to do so today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Formerly a teacher and community rabbi in Jerusalem, Rabbi Mordechai Stern now resides in Crown Heights. In the summers he leads Congregation Beis Menachem in Tannersville, New York. He was interviewed in May 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>THIS TEST HAS BEEN CANCELED</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/644.-Emor-5785.pdf</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/644.-Emor-5785.pdf</guid>
      <description>After troubling test results, a young Sephardi expectant mother was advised to abort—but turned to the Rebbe instead. He told her to stop testing and blessed her with a healthy child. She followed his guidance—and gave birth to a healthy baby boy.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After her family emigrated from Morocco, my mother was born in Montreal, where she was raised. Although they weren’t Torah-observant, they were traditional Sephardim, holding regular Shabbat meals and a Passover Seder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, by the time she met my father, who had grown up in an observant, Yemenite family in Israel, she was living in New York and getting more connected with her Judaism. When they got married in 1987, they committed to leading a fully observant life together, settling in the Lubavitcher community of Crown Heights. Soon after, they were expecting their first child. It was all very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, early on in the pregnancy, my mother took the alpha-fetoprotein test to check for birth defects. The results were not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the doctors explained, the levels of alpha-fetoprotein in her blood meant one of three things: The baby would have severe digestive issues, some kind of birth defect in the brain or spine, or Down’s syndrome. These outcomes were not presented to her as possibilities or even probabilities; it was definitive. And so, once they had received these results, my mother’s doctors were advising her to abort the baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time, my grandmother had come to Crown Heights to offer support. “You’re young,” she told her daughter. “How are you going to raise a special needs child? Whatever the doctors advise, that’s what we’re going to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought of having a special needs child raised so many questions for my mother: &lt;em&gt;Would she have to stop working? Would my father be able to earn enough on his own? What would it mean for their ability to have more children?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this was where the &lt;em&gt;chasidim&lt;/em&gt; came in. Most of her friends at this time were Lubavitchers, as well as her work colleagues and her boss, and they were all telling her to do the same thing: &lt;em&gt;Write to the Rebbe and ask him what to do! &lt;/em&gt;My mother’s brother had a serious medical condition, and she would frequently go to the Rebbe to ask for blessings on his behalf, so she asked my father what he thought about consulting with the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m all for it,” my father said, “but let’s be clear about what we’re doing. We’re not just getting his advice for consideration; his opinion can’t be cast aside. If we’re not willing to commit to what he says, then we should just keep to the doctor’s recommendation without asking him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my father’s family, the concept of &lt;em&gt;emunat chachamim &lt;/em&gt;– faith in Torah sages – was very strong, and it was a big part of my mother’s traditional Sephardic upbringing as well. So after thinking the matter over for some time, they came to a joint conclusion: They would have faith, and adhere to whatever the Rebbe says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mother wrote to the Rebbe, describing their situation, and shortly thereafter, she received a message from the Rebbe’s office. The Rebbe had requested to see the files relating to her pregnancy. She had them sent over, directly from the doctor’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, my mother had been scheduled for further testing, specifically for amniocentesis, which looks for genetic issues like Down’s syndrome. The very night before she was due to go to Maimonides Hospital for the test, she received a phone call from Rabbi Leibel Groner, the Rebbe’s secretary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Rebbe said to stop taking these tests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then stipulated that she should still take the test for diabetes – the condition runs in our family – “but don’t take any more tests connected with the genetic issues that the doctors have been speaking about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe gave her a blessing for a healthy child and said that everything would be okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing that, my mother didn’t show up at Maimonides for the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors accepted her decision and went on with business as usual, treating it as a normal pregnancy, with regular visits and ultrasounds. At first, she didn’t tell her mother, but when she eventually did, my grandmother was devastated – and deeply worried. Still, she continued to stand by my mother’s side as the pregnancy progressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, when the time came, she gave birth to a completely healthy baby boy, without any medical issues at all: me. My mother even told me that I scored quite high on the Apgar test that is used to assess babies’ health right after they are born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only issue was that I was born a little jaundiced, so the circumcision had to be pushed off by a week. On the day of the &lt;em&gt;brit&lt;/em&gt;, my parents received a letter from the Rebbe, wishing them Mazal Tov, and blessing them to raise me to study Torah, perform good deeds, and eventually to marry me off under the &lt;em&gt;chuppah.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That additional blessing on the day of the &lt;em&gt;brit &lt;/em&gt;brought my mother an extra sense of closure and a feeling of calm after this difficult ordeal; it was like the stamp that sealed the entire story for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a young child, she would always tell me this story. “You have a connection with the Rebbe from the very beginning of your life,” she would say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked my mother how she felt after receiving the Rebbe’s answer, she told me that she was definitely still afraid and anxious about the future. There was a lot going on: She was young, it was her first year of marriage, she and her husband were both from different countries, and she was at the beginning of her journey to observant Judaism – and all while carrying this baby. Deciding to follow the Rebbe’s advice and continue with the pregnancy was difficult for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet despite all this, in a way that she couldn’t quite put it into words, she felt a special connection with the Rebbe. And based on this connection, she was able to make her decision with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Yechiel Haboura is a third-grade Judaic studies teacher at Yeshiva Beth Yehuda in Detroit. He was interviewed in March 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>THE HISTORY OF MY FUTURE</title>

      <description>After years of infertility, a couple followed the Rebbe’s guidance through surgeries, doctors, and blessings. Despite setbacks, they persevered. Eighteen years after their wedding, they welcomed twin boys, then a daughter.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My wife Ruty and I got married in 1983, and after a few years went by without any children, it became obvious that there was an issue. This began our long struggle with infertility; private, painful, hard – and amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first we hoped that it could easily be fixed, but the doctor we went to gave us the bad news that it was not so simple. I needed to undergo a couple of surgical procedures, which the Rebbe encouraged, and even though the results were negative, his encouragement gave us the belief that it would all work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point in this arduous journey, the Rebbe advised us to follow the counsel of “a doctor who is a friend,” and so we went to more doctors. We also tried various spiritual remedies, special food, and Kabbalistic prayers, but nothing seemed to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once, I was complaining about all this to my father, Reb Berel Weiss, who had a very close relationship with the Rebbe, and he decided that we would make a special trip to New York to ask the Rebbe for another blessing for my wife and me. The holiday of Lag B’omer was coming up, and traditionally, on this auspicious day in particular, the Rebbes of Chabad would give blessings for couples to have children. There was also a large children’s parade being held that year, and my father had been asked to sponsor it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, in 1990, we traveled together from Los Angeles, arriving on the morning of Lag B’omer. The parade, held in front of 770 and presided over by the Rebbe, was amazing, and when it was finished, he looked like he was in heaven. “You can’t approach the Rebbe right now,” one of his secretaries said. “It’s not an appropriate time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after, though, the Rebbe would be going to immerse in the &lt;em&gt;mikveh&lt;/em&gt;, and so we stood in the driveway outside of 770, hoping to see him when he left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time came and the Rebbe walked out, he went straight over to my father. “Did you get a medallion yet?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, the Rebbe had given out a special commemorative coin in honor of Lag B’omer and by then we had already gone to his secretariat’s office to receive one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see my father struggle to answer: Had he said no, the Rebbe would have handed him one of those special commemorative coins in person, but of course he couldn’t lie. “Yes, I got one,” he finally replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I answered the same when the Rebbe asked me, and then he went into his car – before we had a chance to ask him anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we then tried to speak with him after the &lt;em&gt;mikveh&lt;/em&gt;, there were other people waiting in front of the building to ask for his blessings and we couldn’t get a word in edgewise. After that, he went to pray at the resting place of the Previous Rebbe, and we wouldn’t disturb him there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s just not meant to be,” I told my father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was past 10:00 PM when the Rebbe came back from the Previous Rebbe’s resting place to 770. After the evening service, he proceeded to give out dollars for charity to the people in the synagogue. It was quite late, and because the Rebbe had been on his feet all day, everyone took the dollar and kept moving without stopping to speak with him. But my father stood firm. Feeling dejected, I didn’t even bother joining him in the line, but from a distance, I watched as he approached the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today is an auspicious day,” he said, “and I’ve come to ask for a blessing for my son.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But Rashbi is here,” the Rebbe replied, referring to the great sage Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai, whose passing is commemorated on Lag B’omer. &lt;em&gt;Today is his day&lt;/em&gt;, he seemed to be saying. &lt;em&gt;Why are you coming to me for a blessing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to have a blessing from &lt;em&gt;this &lt;/em&gt;Rashbi,” my father insisted, and pointed at the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe smiled, and looking at my father, said “&lt;em&gt;Amen&lt;/em&gt;. May there be sons and daughters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Amen&lt;/em&gt;!” my father replied. His face lit up as he turned around and nodded to me, as if to say, “Moshe, you’re all set!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But another year went by and nothing happened. Rabbi Shmuel Dovid Raichik, who was our family rabbi, saw my pain, and he encouraged me to go and meet with the Rebbe again. Although by 1991, the Rebbe no longer held any private audiences, he would meet with the major donors to Chabad’s central fundraising arm, the Machne Israel Development Fund, twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I felt I had the ability to do so, I made the financial commitment, and following Rosh Hashanah of that year, my wife and I went to the Rebbe, accompanied by Rabbi Raichik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the occasion arrived, and we were able to meet with the Rebbe face to face, it was a majestic scene. My wife asked for a blessing for children, and the Rebbe gave us a few dollars and pieces of honey cake – as is traditional in the period before Yom Kippur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Give these [dollars] to charity,” he said, “and you should have good news over the course of this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been thinking long and hard before this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I told myself that I needed more than another blessing. I needed guidance. And so, instead of just answering &lt;em&gt;Amen&lt;/em&gt;, I tried to have a dialogue with the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Rebbe told us to see a doctor who is a friend,” I began, “but the doctors say there’s nothing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You should look for another doctor,” the Rebbe said, “until you find a doctor who is truly a friend, who will advise you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the last time the Rebbe met with the Machne Israel Development Fund before his stroke the following year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-meaning people continued to tell us about doctors all around the world – we saw a doctor in Argentina, in Canada, and several in Israel – but after the Rebbe passed away in 1994, I struggled to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One doctor in Herzliya told me that all these medical institutions were withholding the truth from me. “The only reason that we’re taking you is because it pays to have American patients.” I was shocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in Israel, I began to spend time with the Amshinover Rebbe, a saintly man whom I became quite close with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I came to say goodbye,” I told him one day. “I’m giving up all of the medical treatments, so I don’t know when I will be back in Israel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can you think of stopping?” he protested. “The Rebbe told you that you’re going to have children! I want you to go to Dr. Aby Levine in Hadassah Hospital in Ein Kerem. You must go. The Rebbe told you not to stop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had the Rebbe not told me to keep going until we find a doctor who says we can do it, I would certainly have given up. I don’t even know where we found the energy to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But finally, less than a year after that introduction to Dr. Levine – and eighteen years after our wedding – my wife gave birth to twin boys, and then, a year after that, to a little girl. The Rebbe’s guidance and his blessings were finally fulfilled in a beautiful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Moshe Weiss serves as the director of Chabad of Sherman Oaks, California, while also involved in numerous business and investment ventures. He was interviewed in September 2011.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GAME, SET, WRAP</title>

      <description>A Miami principal got businessman Mel Landow to put on tefillin after a tennis bet. Inspired, Mel donated generously to Jewish education. A meeting with the Rebbe shifted his focus to helping Jewish youth, impacting thousands through his support.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Not long after moving to Miami to become the principal of the Oholei Torah school, in 1970, I began teaching a Tuesday night Torah class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One person who would attend and sometimes host this class was a local tennis champion named David Lifshultz. One day, David mentioned that he played a regular game with the owner of Kennedy and Cohen, a major regional retailer of large appliances. His name was Mel Landow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would like to see if I could put on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; with him,” I told David.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David had his doubts over whether that could happen, but he told me when and where to catch Mel. I came to the tennis court and, between games, I interjected: “How about &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mel declined at first, but I proposed a bet: “If David wins the game, you put on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with being one of the great entrepreneurs of South Florida, Mel was an excellent tennis player, so he accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dave, give us your best,” I cheered, and of course David beat him. Right after the game, Mel went with me to my car, where he put on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something touched him in this experience, and he started attending my Tuesday night class, as well. We used to study the Rebbe’s talks in that class, and Mel became enamored with the Rebbe and his approach to education. But, when I offered &lt;em&gt;tefillin &lt;/em&gt;again, he turned me down. “It’s not relevant to me,” he would say. “Don’t talk to me about &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, one day in 1972, as our school was experiencing some financial troubles, Mel called me over to his house. He said that his company was going public, and with his payout, he wanted to give half a million dollars to build a new Jewish school building. Back then, such a large sum was unheard of, and it was only the beginning of Mel Landow’s involvement. I called the Rebbe right away to give over the good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later, the Rebbe’s secretary, Rabbi Hodakov, called. “It would be a fine thing if you could put on &lt;em&gt;tefillin &lt;/em&gt;with Mordechai Shaul Landow,” he said, using Mel’s Hebrew name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s a very difficult thing to do.” I began to deflect, but then all of a sudden, I heard the voice of the Rebbe, who had been listening on an extension. I jumped out of my chair; I had never heard him on the telephone before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tell him that I’m going to Ohel.” He was referring to the resting place of the Previous Rebbe, where he would often go to pray. Rabbi Hodakov explained that I should tell Mel that this would be an opportune time for him to put on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Beautiful &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;,” I then heard the Rebbe say, followed by Rabbi Hodakov’s clarification that I should make sure to bring a nice pair of &lt;em&gt;tefillin &lt;/em&gt;for Mel to put on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, only low-quality &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt; were sold in Miami, but then I heard the Rebbe’s voice again, suggesting that I use my own &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;, but with nice cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got off the phone, went to the local Jewish bookstore, bought a pair of sixty dollar &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;, put the new cases on my &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;, and went to meet Mel. He was playing tennis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know Mel,” I began, “this is going to sound strange, but would you like to put on &lt;em&gt;tefillin &lt;/em&gt;today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s so special about today?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told him about the Rebbe going to the Ohel, adding that, the Rebbe would surely pray for him when he heard about Mel putting on &lt;em&gt;tefillin&lt;/em&gt;. He agreed. In fact, from that day on, he began putting on &lt;em&gt;tefillin &lt;/em&gt;every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, I decided that Mel should go to meet the Rebbe, and we made an appointment. Mel brought along some plans he had been developing for the school in Miami, as well as for a big project he wanted to build in Israel. This development was going to have golf courses, clubhouses, tennis courts, convention facilities, and the best spa in the world; and the Israeli government was going to give him the land to do all of it. Actually, he was meeting the Israeli finance minister, Pinchas Sapir, the next morning, and we were going to fly back to Miami together that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we waited to go into the Rebbe’s room, the time for our flight crept closer. Mel began asking some of the other people what they had come for. After hearing about how one person had this business problem, and another person had that health problem, he turned to me: “Sholom, let’s go back. The Rebbe has so much to do. We shouldn’t bother him with our stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No,” I replied. “This is not the kind of meeting that you skip if it gets late.” We found another 3:00 AM flight through Atlanta that would get us into Miami in the morning, and we stayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time came, I went into the Rebbe’s office together with Mel, introduced him, and then walked out. I wanted him to be alone with the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I came to tell you that we’re going to do everything right in Israel,” was the first thing he said to the Rebbe. “The Jewish people are going to be great.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe looked at him and said, “Everything is great? How about the hundreds of thousands of Jewish kids who are lost in the streets? How about the ones involved in drugs?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, Rebbe,” countered Mel, “let me tell you what I’m going to do in Israel.” He then pulled out his plans and showed the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let me ask you,” the Rebbe said. “When you bring someone into your house, do you take him to your library and your living room, or do you take him to your bathroom?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The library and living room, of course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So why are you building bathrooms in Israel?” The Rebbe felt that there were more important things to do in the Holy Land than building a spa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was there for over an hour, and he came out in shock. We ended up spending the rest of that night speaking about the Rebbe, before arriving in Miami in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That afternoon, I got a call from Rabbi Hodakov, who had a message from the Rebbe for Mel: “I met a Jew to whom G-d has given powers which even I do not possess. Through them, he will bring hundreds of thousands of Jewish children back to their roots. Normally, one does not see the foundations of a building, but here, I have seen strong, deep foundations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, a letter from the Rebbe came by special delivery. It began like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…I had wondered what your reactions might be to my ‘un-American’ manner of welcoming you. For, the accepted American way, if I am not mistaken, is to greet one with a shower of compliments and praise.… Yet, instead of verbalizing my appreciation at length, I… immediately challenged you with new and formidable projects…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I felt impelled to use the precious time at our disposal to discuss with you those matters… of vital importance…. Moreover, I was hopeful that you would accept my suggestions in the right spirit, precisely because you have already made a magnificent start….”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that magnificent start, thousands of children have learned in the school building that Mel Landow sponsored and supported over the years, many of whom have gone on to lead communities themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Sholom Ber Lipskar has been serving as a Chabad emissary in Florida since 1969. After serving as the principal of the Landow Yeshiva Center (today LEC) for several years, he founded The Shul of Bal Harbour in 1982. He was interviewed four times in the years 2009, 2011, and 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ONE VISION, TWO ARCHITECTS, AND FOUR MIRACULOUS STORIES</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/641.-Shmini-5785.pdf</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/641.-Shmini-5785.pdf</guid>
      <description>In 1985, the Rebbe requested a 770-style building in Kfar Chabad. Despite major challenges, it was miraculously completed within months and became a hub for Torah and outreach.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1985, the Rebbe summoned the board of Agudas Chassidei Chabad, the Chabad movement’s umbrella organization, to his office. Among other matters, he had a request: The establishment of a new building in Kfar Chabad, Israel, to be named for the Previous Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn. It was to serve as a center for prayer, Torah study, and the spreading of &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks later, during a public &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt; for the 12th of Tammuz – the anniversary of the Previous Rebbe’s liberation from Soviet prison – the Rebbe spoke, for the first time in public, about a theft that had taken place at the Agudas Chassidei Chabad library, the central archive of the Lubavitch movement. Over a period of time, hundreds of priceless books and other items had begun disappearing – taken, it later emerged, by the Previous Rebbe’s grandson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attempt by a private individual to lay claim to the Previous Rebbe’s library was a source of great pain to the Rebbe, who saw it as a spiritual attack on himself and the Chabad movement. And so over the next few years, alongside the legal response, he launched a spiritual campaign to avert this Heavenly decree. Practically, this meant expanding Chabad’s work of promoting Torah and &lt;em&gt;mitzvot&lt;/em&gt;. Two days after that address, during an audience with a group of visitors, the Rebbe once again spoke about making a new building in Kfar Chabad. He even asked that a “property for the Previous Rebbe” be found that very day – as a rental, until construction could begin – in order to house the local Kollel, or advanced Torah institute, as well as a Torah library. It seemed that this building was part of the same spiritual campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kfar Chabad village committee quickly convened to allocate a building, while they searched for a permanent site. Eventually, a suitable parcel of land was found on a hill near the village’s entrance that was still officially classified as agricultural land. Although rezoning normally takes years, the Rebbe insisted that no part of the construction could begin before the building permits were in place, so with the help of the relevant government offices, the entire process was completed within six months. The search for an architect, however, was already well underway – which is where I came into the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; architect, this was the opportunity of a lifetime. Both excited and anxious about the responsibility, I submitted my candidacy, along with many other architects. Eventually, only two candidates remained: Myself and another Chabad &lt;em&gt;chasid&lt;/em&gt;, Aryeh Yakont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew Aryeh and gave him a call: “I’m afraid to take on this project alone,” I told him. “Let’s do it together.” Aryeh admitted that he felt the same. Relieved, the committee awarded us the job jointly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, the Rebbe requested that the building be modeled after the “Agudat Chasidei Chabad” building in New York – better known as 770 Eastern Parkway, the world headquarters of Chabad. Spanning about 1,200 square meters across four levels – not including the adjoining office building and main synagogue – the unique architectural features of 770 make it stand out among its neighbors on Eastern Parkway. However, no architectural blueprints existed for the original 1934 building, and a search through the New York City archives yielded nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the committee wanted to fly one of the architects to New York in order to recreate the blueprints, but the Rebbe insisted that we keep costs down, and so we had a committee member who was planning to travel to 770 for the High Holidays take measurements of the building. Although he had no formal training, it was enough to draft preliminary blueprints and then, with the help of a structural engineer, submit the plans for approval. We then managed to get a contractor to commit to complete the framework for only $83,000, in honor of the Rebbe’s 83 years and in time for his next birthday, on the 11th of Nissan, 1986. All of this was the easy part. We still didn’t have detailed architectural plans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to take a personal trip to 770; not at the project’s expense, but as a &lt;em&gt;chasid &lt;/em&gt;visiting his Rebbe. While there, I meticulously measured the entire building and took over 500 photos of its unique features—the ornaments, moldings, chimneys, and the numerous stained-glass windows. Finally, we were finally able to move forward with the planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framework was ready on time, but then construction slowed. Eventually, the Rebbe addressed the delay in construction at the Lag B’Omer &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;: “Like idle people—they started building, and got stuck halfway…” To speed things up, he promised to send additional funds, urging that the building be completed in time for the 12th of Tammuz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt; was broadcast live to Israel and right after it ended, at 4:00 AM Israel time, I got a call summoning me to an emergency committee meeting in Kfar Chabad. The committee had calculated that they only had 33 working days left. In my professional assessment, completing the remaining work in such a short time was nearly impossible, but the Rebbe wanted it, and so we started running at an abnormal pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each week, I left home after Shabbat and returned before candle lighting the next Friday. We located the one factory in Israel that could produce 770’s signature red bricks, and they agreed to halt all other production to focus on our project. We had four bricklaying crews working simultaneously, local Arab artisans making chimney caps and window frames, and a variety of craftsmen producing casting molds. There were approximately 150 workers on site, some of them working as late as two or three in the morning. We had no choice but to abandon conventional building order—plastering one area while laying tiles in another, before the walls had even been finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a company that could create roughly 100 meters of stained-glass windows was another struggle. Eventually, one leading company agreed to focus solely on our project for four months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Four months?” we laughed. “We need them in one!” They were going to walk out, but we insisted. “If the Rebbe said it, it will happen!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our enthusiasm must have been contagious, because they agreed. “We don’t know how, but we’ll do it!” They asked for the exact window measurements, but the walls weren’t even up yet. Normally, making the calculations for stained glass backwards would guarantee errors — but miraculously, they completed all the work on time, without a millimeter’s mistake. I don’t know how they did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, the 12th of Tammuz fell on Shabbat, and the Rebbe requested that the building’s dedication ceremony be held on the 15th—exactly one year after he had first spoken about the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the magnificent building has stood proudly on that hill, clearly visible to everyone traveling past on Israel’s Highway 1. Its four stories house a large study hall and library, as well as the Kehot publishing house and the editorial offices of the “Kfar Chabad” magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day of the dedication, the Rebbe spoke about the new building, and about the “soul of this house – the Torah and the guidance that will emanate from Kfar Chabad’s 770, as it emanates from the 770 here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I was too exhausted to sit through the dedication. An IDF general who spoke at an adjacent event held that same day – Chabad’s annual Bar Mitzvah celebration for the orphans of fallen soldiers – quipped: “We’ve had many successful operations – but I don’t know if we could do what they did!” I felt the greatest sense of privilege; all those challenges, and all my architectural studies, were worth it just to reach that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mordechai Gorelik&lt;/em&gt; is a&lt;em&gt;n engineer and architect who resides in Nachalat Har Chabad, Israel. He was interviewed in his home in December of 2013.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GROWING IN CONFIDENCE</title>

      <description>Drawn to Chabad, a student sought guidance about transferring. The Rebbe’s thoughtful reply showed care. Later, advice on Torah, trust, and flexibility helped him overcome a stutter and become an emissary.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a religious home, very distant from Chabad. But while studying at Jerusalem’s Kol Torah &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; in the 1960s, I began attending a secret class on &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; thought, and as those teachings sank in, I started to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From time to time, I would visit the &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; in Kfar Chabad to take part in &lt;em&gt;farbrengens&lt;/em&gt; led by the renowned &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; mentor Rabbi Shlomo Chaim Kesselman. Those gatherings made a strong impression on me, as did the &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; students themselves, who showed such love for their fellow Jews, especially in the way they welcomed us guests from other&lt;em&gt; yeshivot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I began thinking about transferring to the Chabad &lt;em&gt;yeshivah &lt;/em&gt;in Kfar Chabad. Aghast, my father sent several rabbis to dissuade me, which made me doubt whether it was the right decision. I decided to ask the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a detailed letter recounting all of this, and in his response, the Rebbe circled the part where I mentioned my doubts and wrote: “Based on this – stay and do not change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was precisely those words that ultimately prompted me to transfer. I realized – contrary to what others had claimed – that the Rebbe wasn’t bent on bringing people into Chabad at any cost. He actually cared and thought about me. If I had doubts, regardless of their origin or validity, he preferred that I not make the move. So I stayed, until eventually, I felt confident that transferring was right for me. When I wrote to the Rebbe to say that my doubts had disappeared, I received his blessing to go to Kfar Chabad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years later, I went to study in the Rebbe’s presence, in New York. I arrived in 770 one afternoon before Passover of 1973, shortly before the Mincha prayers. A few months earlier, my mother had passed away following a severe illness. Although someone in his year of mourning traditionally leads the prayers, because I suffered from a severe stutter, I sufficed with reciting the Kaddish; reading along with others helped ease my impediment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, as I prepared for that first Mincha with the Rebbe, I felt terrible about being unable to lead the prayers. So, not wanting the Rebbe to notice, I stood in the northwest corner of the synagogue; he generally faced the other direction after the prayers, or so I was told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I lifted my eyes up after reciting the final Kaddish, I saw the Rebbe looking at me. I immediately lowered my gaze, waited a few seconds, and looked up again. But the Rebbe was still looking straight at me, with a gaze I will remember all my life. Finally, he gave me a slight nod and turned to go. “Welcome,” he seemed to be saying. “I understand, and you don’t have to feel bad. I’m with you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I had the honor of a private audience with the Rebbe later that year, on the occasion of my twenty-third birthday, I prepared a long letter in advance, listing all of my questions and issues – among them my stutter, which bothered me deeply. When, late at night, I finally entered his room, the Rebbe quickly leafed through the pages of my letter, before responding in detail to each question, in order, without looking at it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding my stutter, the Rebbe gave me two suggestions: First, to strengthen my trust in G-d. As I understand it, this doesn’t just mean having faith, but recognizing that if I have some deficiency, it’s because G-d wants me to discover a new, inner strength that will compensate for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, if I ever get stuck on a particular word, rather than trying to force it out, I should choose a different word – express myself in a different way. I took this as a life lesson: When we run into some obstacle, rather than trying the same method again and again, we should look for a new path to reach our goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another question I asked was about my &lt;em&gt;shlichut,&lt;/em&gt; my mission in life. If it was going to be Jewish outreach, I felt that I needed to be learning now about how to be a positive influence on others and how to present the fundamentals of Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right now you are a &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; student,” replied the Rebbe. “Your mission now is to study Torah diligently, and to engage in heartfelt prayer.” In other words, you must live in the present. Thinking about the future will only distract you from your current mission. When the time comes, you’ll see what your life mission is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, my father – despite his previous opposition to Chabad – saw that I was continuing to study Torah seriously, and he began to draw closer to the Rebbe himself. While I was in New York, he even came for a private audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the audience, my father asked for a blessing to marry off his two children: myself, and my sister who was about ten years older than me and still unmarried. The Rebbe looked him in the eye and said, “She will marry. He will marry. But you need to worry now that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; will marry.” That is, he strongly encouraged my father to remarry, following the passing of my mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, the Rebbe didn’t think I needed to get married just yet. “What do you want from him?” he asked my father. “He is busy learning Torah!” But in time, I did get married, and so did my sister. My father, however, didn’t appreciate the Rebbe’s advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I should get married?” he wondered after the meeting. “My children should!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, when he saw how hard being alone could be, he remarked to me: “Now I understand what the Rebbe told me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that same audience, the Rebbe also urged my father to increase the time he set aside for Torah study. My father objected. He already had a regular study session in the morning and another one straight after work. “I don’t have time for more!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, my father happened to be a very talented food chemist, with several patents to his name, and although he never mentioned this in that audience, the Rebbe responded with an analogy from chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every chemist knows,” the Rebbe said, “that even a tiny addition to a mixture can significantly change the entire composition. The same applies in spirituality. Going beyond your habit and your nature by adding even a little extra Torah study has the power to influence your whole day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Rebbe gave me the advice about my stutter, I followed it, and although it helped somewhat, it did not change me or resolve the issue. As the Rebbe understood, stuttering is generally not a physical issue, but a psychological or an emotional one; it’s in your head, a result of looking at yourself a certain way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Rebbe continuously encouraged me to go beyond my limits, as a &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; student, when I became a Chabad emissary in Antwerp, Belgium – after I got married – and later on as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, our work in Antwerp was very challenging, but in time, things opened up. I began to work on the problem with my speech, and thank G-d, today I have no difficulty speaking or giving classes – things I hadn’t dreamed of before. We understood that we had to believe in ourselves and our abilities – just as the Rebbe believed in us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Shabtai Slavaticki has served as a Chabad emissary in Antwerp, Belgium, since 1977. He was interviewed in the My Encounter studio in July 2018.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ENGINE TROUBLE TO THE RESCUE</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/639.-Tzav-5785.pdf</link>

      <description>Changed travel plans led Rabbi Yosef Wineberg to forge a deep bond with Dakar’s Jewish community, igniting their spirit and establishing a lasting connection between the Rebbe and the small West African enclave.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the early 1950s, I set out on a trip to South Africa to raise funds for the Lubavitcher yeshivah system. Beforehand, I met with the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you stopping anywhere on the way for a day or two?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was flying direct with Pan-American Airlines, but in those days, that still meant making a few refueling stops: in the Azores islands, Portugal, Senegal, Ghana, and Belgian Congo. So I mentioned all of these places to the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But don’t you have to stop on the way for a day or two?” he repeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“According to our schedule, we aren’t supposed to,” was all I could say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I came home that day, I told my wife what had happened. “I think I’ll end up making a stopover somewhere,” I told her. Of course, not knowing where, I just told her not to worry if she doesn’t get a telegram that I had safely arrived in South Africa at the expected time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the airport in New York, I met a fellow named Mr. Langer, who was also traveling to South Africa to visit his daughter. We had a two-day journey ahead of us, so we were happy to be traveling together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around halfway through the trip, we landed in Dakar, Senegal, which was then still a French colony. As we waited for the plane to refuel, I took out a Torah book. I began to study when I noticed a young, dark-skinned man staring at me. I continued what I was doing, but it was quite hot so I took off my hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as this man saw my yarmulke underneath, he came over. “There are some French people with beards, so I didn’t know whether you are a Jew until you took off your hat,” he explained. “I’ve been living here for six months, and I haven’t seen a Jewish face in all that time. I’m so happy to see you now!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I come from a place with quite a few Jews, New York,” I replied, “but I’m still happy to meet a Jewish man in Dakar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began to make conversation, and I learned that his name was Pinto – he was an engineer working for an oil company. He had a wife and two daughters, and had been transferred from his home in Egypt for a job in Senegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you have your tefillin?” I queried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did – but he did not put them on every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even a Jew living in Jerusalem has the duty and the privilege of putting on tefillin every day,” I told him. “But for a person living here, it is even more crucial. How else will your daughters know that they are Jewish?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got a point there,” he conceded, and he promised to put on tefillin regularly. I was pleased with that, and I headed back to our plane for the next leg, from Dakar to Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was meant to be a six-hour flight, but two hours in, we were woken up – there was engine trouble, and we had to turn around. Thank G-d, we managed to land safely in Dakar, but then the pilot came out to inform us that the engine was completely out of order. It would have to be replaced with an entirely new engine that needed to be brought from London – “in no less than forty-eight hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airline took us to a half-decent hotel in the city, and the next morning, after praying, I told Mr. Langer that I was heading out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Where are you going?” he protested. “Do you even know French?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know French, but the Rebbe asked me twice about stopping along the way. There must be something I’m supposed to do here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went out to the street and began asking around, until finally I met a Portuguese man – whose language I could speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are there any Jews here?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man pointed me to a store just across the street, which belonged to a Jew. I walked in and met the owner’s nephew, a young man from Lebanon named Clement Polity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up spending most of the next two days with Clement. He introduced me to four more Jewish families, while I met another Jewish person at our hotel. Clement arranged a meeting with the locals so that I could speak with them about Judaism, and because he spoke fluent English, he was able to translate into French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, he turned to me: “Rabbi, I have a personal question. There are no single Jewish girls here; what am I supposed to do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to explain the importance of marrying within the faith, but I didn’t have to work hard. Clement came from a beautiful religious family, and so he understood. He shook hands with me and promised that he would go to France to look for a Jewish girl there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rabbi,” he told me before we left, “you will never know what these two days meant for me.” By then, our plane had been fixed, and he took me back to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, I wrote a letter to the Rebbe, telling him about this little community and all of the things they needed. Soon after, a package went out from the Rebbe’s office with tefillin, as well as some French prayer books and chumashim. Then, before Passover, the Rebbe sent them a package of matzah, by airmail, to make sure it arrived on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime after Passover, the Rebbe received a letter, signed by both Pinto and Clement. They recounted how, at the community Seder they made – with the Rebbe’s matzah – they spoke about how, despite being so busy and so far away, the Rebbe still put in the time and effort to send them tefillin and matzah, without requesting anything in return. This is how a Jew is supposed to behave, they told their children. This letter, which the Rebbe sent on to me, was written with such emotion that it brought tears to my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That summer, I told the Rebbe that I was going back to South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you stopping in Dakar?” the Rebbe asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” I answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even if the plane is in order, you should spend a few days with the families there. But this time, give them notice beforehand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then a few more Jewish families had moved there from Egypt, and we learned that the American vice-consul was Jewish, as well. The community got me a room at a beautiful hotel, then came to meet me, and we had a nice farbrengen together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything was fine, except that Clement Polity was still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clement, you promised me something,” I told him when he came to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I kept my promise,” he insisted. “I went to France but I didn’t find anyone there. But don’t you worry – I’ll keep trying!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six or seven months later, two wedding invitations arrived in the mail – one for the Rebbe and one for me. Clement had found a fine Jewish girl in Lebanon. Later on, he became the chairman of Dakar’s Jewish community, and he submitted his name to be published in a local travel guide, along with a notice: “Any Jew who comes to Dakar can call me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The vice-chairman of United Lubavitcher Yeshivos, Rabbi Yosef Wineberg (1918-2012) traveled the globe raising funds for the institution and reaching out to Jewish people in far-flung places. He was interviewed three times, in the years 2008 and 2009.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>YOU'VE BEEN ACCEPTED!</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/638.-Vayikra-5785.pdf</link>

      <description>A secular Jewish family struggled with feeling fully accepted by the Chabad community. During a visit to the Rebbe, an unexpected gesture toward their young son affirmed their place within the community.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We were a typical American Jewish family. My father was an attorney, and my mother a teacher, and they had a daughter, a son, and a dog. We were members of our Conservative synagogue in Pittsburgh, where my father sang in the choir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my mother didn’t like our local public school system, and she wanted to see what else was out there. She went to check out the local Lubavitch day school, which impressed her, and she ended up sending my older sister and me there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly but surely, we started learning, and then adopting, more and more of traditional Judaism. The community of families who sent their children to Lubavitch was a closely connected group, but a mixed one. Some were Chabad &lt;em&gt;chasidim &lt;/em&gt;of course, but most came from other sects of Orthodox Judaism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then, in the early 70s, there were not many families like ours in Pittsburgh who were becoming more observant. While we enjoyed the camaraderie of the community, many people weren’t sure what to make of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s nice that you’re getting involved with Lubavitch and becoming more religious,” one of the non-Lubavitch women in the community told my mother at one point. “Really, it’s wonderful. But you should also know that you’re never going to be one of them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This woman wasn’t trying to be mean. She thought it was for our good that we not have unrealistic expectations about our ability to integrate and become a part of this &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; community. Nevertheless, my mother didn’t know what to make of it: &lt;em&gt;Are we accepted in this community? Are we not? Are we halfway? &lt;/em&gt;And so she decided to write to the Rebbe, introducing herself and asking this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe didn’t respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That summer, we were going to the beach in New Jersey for a vacation. At that point, we had already begun keeping Shabbat, so we decided to spend the weekend in Crown Heights, with the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a public &lt;em&gt;farbrengen &lt;/em&gt;that Thursday night, which meant that the Rebbe wasn’t holding any private audiences then. Instead, the next day, just an hour or so before Shabbat, our family had an opportunity to meet with the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent only two or three minutes there in his office. The Rebbe spoke to my parents, and one of the things they discussed was – seeing as they were still involved with the Conservative synagogue – influencing and inspiring their friends to do more &lt;em&gt;mitzvot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying, Rebbe,” my mother said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Try harder,” the Rebbe said with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Try harder” had always been a motto of my mother’s, even before meeting the Rebbe, and it certainly was afterward; she began to take every opportunity to bring more Judaism into people’s lives. The Rebbe gave us a blessing, and we left to get ready for Shabbat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, on Shabbat afternoon, the Rebbe held another &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;. We were staying with the Zarchi family on President Street – Aliza Zarchi is originally from Pittsburgh – and so after lunch, my father went off with Rabbi Hershel Zarchi to 770. Only seven at the time, I didn’t appreciate the moment and I wasn’t terribly interested in going to a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen &lt;/em&gt;to hear a rabbi speaking in a language that I didn’t understand. Instead, I went to take a nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as I was settling down, I heard banging on the door. It was Hershel Zarchi, out of breath, having run straight from 770. He looked at me and pointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Rebbe wants you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you mean?” everyone asked. “What happened?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that, as is traditional at &lt;em&gt;farbrengens&lt;/em&gt;, my father held up a cup of wine to say &lt;em&gt;l’chaim &lt;/em&gt;with the Rebbe. The Rebbe looked at him to respond, and then motioned with his hands as if to say: &lt;em&gt;Where’s your little boy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabbi Zarchi went out of his mind: There was someone in his house that the Rebbe had just asked for! So, he ran back home, told me to get dressed, grabbed my hand, and we flew out the door. We ran down Kingston Avenue so quickly that I’m not sure my feet even touched the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got to 770, there was no way for me to walk over to my father; he was sitting on one of the benches in the middle of the synagogue, surrounded by a mass of humanity. Instead, I was hoisted up and crowd-surfed until I got to my father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, my mother and sister also came along and were able to watch this extraordinary moment from the women’s section. Looking down from the balcony, my mother said it was like looking at a black canvas with two dots of color: My red crocheted vest, and my father’s tan suit, surrounded by black hats and jackets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time, the Rebbe was addressing the crowd again, but when he concluded the talk, I was handed a little cup of my own, to say &lt;em&gt;l’chaim &lt;/em&gt;to the Rebbe&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;When I held it up, the Rebbe motioned to me: &lt;em&gt;Come here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started navigating my way over to the Rebbe’s table, squeezing between people and climbing over benches, until I arrived. The Rebbe poured a drop of wine for me from his own cup and then took a piece of cake from the plate in front of him and wrapped it in a napkin to give it to me – but I was still too far away to reach. I had to climb onto the Rebbe’s table. Then, lying on my stomach, I reached out with my hand. The Rebbe gave me the little cup and the piece of cake. He waited for me to recite the blessings – thankfully I already knew the right &lt;em&gt;brachot &lt;/em&gt;to say – and he answered “&lt;em&gt;Amen&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my mother was watching all of this from the balcony. As she sat there, she overheard two women talking nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who is that kid?” one of them asked, wondering why the Rebbe had called on this little boy in the middle of a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know,” replied the other, “but he must come from a very special family.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing that, my mother later said, changed everything for her. She realized that the Rebbe wasn’t &lt;em&gt;saying&lt;/em&gt; that we were welcome in Lubavitch; he was &lt;em&gt;demonstrating&lt;/em&gt; that we belonged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Rebbe met a little boy the day before, remembered him, and thought it would be meaningful for him to experience a &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;, meant a lot. He was also saying to the rest of my family that he was glad we were present, and that we were fully accepted as a part of his community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message the Rebbe gave us that day was one he always taught: &lt;em&gt;You might be a seven-year-old kid, but you’re important. You’re precious in G-d’s eyes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and you matter to the Jewish people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody expected the Rebbe to single us out in any way, but he did, and it made all the difference. I would even say that was the day my parents became &lt;em&gt;chasidim &lt;/em&gt;of the Rebbe – and my siblings and I followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Pinney Herman and his wife, Helana, served as Chabad emissaries in Raleigh, North Carolina, for over thirty years. Today, they reside in South Florida, where they work as therapists offering individual and couples counseling. They also speak internationally on marriage and Jewish topics. Rabbi Herman was interviewed in March 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I FORGOT MY OWN NAME, AND OTHER ADVENTURES</title>

      <description>In 1952, after complications from surgery left a young mother in critical condition, the Rebbe assured her recovery with a clear promise and sent challah as a sign of blessing. Years later, his attentiveness to her health led to a diagnosis that prevented collapse. His care and guidance saved her...</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When I married my husband, Reb Leibel Mochkin, I was living in Paris as a refugee following the Second World War. In 1952, while I was expecting our first child, we emigrated to Montreal, Canada, and almost as soon as we arrived, my husband went to New York to see the Rebbe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you have a son,” the Rebbe told him “you should name him after my father-in-law,” referring to Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, the Previous Rebbe, who had passed away two years earlier. I gave birth to our daughter Rochel shortly thereafter and two years later we had a son, whom we named Yosef Yitzchak, as the Rebbe had requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I didn’t look sick after the birth, I lost a lot of blood, and I barely ate anything for the next two months. When I came home from the hospital, with two babies to care for, I felt so weak that I could barely hold a glass of water. A couple of weeks after that, I started to have terrible waves of pain in my back. After being checked out, the doctors established that I had developed gallstones during the pregnancy and I would need surgery to have my gallbladder removed. Being only twenty years old, it was quite rare to need such an operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surgery was scheduled for a Tuesday morning at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal. The next day happened to be the Tenth of Shevat, marking the anniversary of the Previous Rebbe’s passing, and my father-in-law, Reb Peretz Mochkin, traveled from Montreal to attend the special gathering with the Rebbe in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several hours after my operation, my medical situation turned critical. My liver stopped functioning, my blood pressure dropped, I fell unconscious, and the doctors decided that I needed to have another operation – the second within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I operate nearly 365 days a year, so I don’t even remember who my patients are,” my surgeon later said, “but I remember that you didn’t let me sleep for three nights.” I had entered a critical condition during that time, and every minute counted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By then, my father-in-law was in New York, and when he heard about what had happened, he was very distraught. At the &lt;em&gt;farbrengen&lt;/em&gt;, he passed the message on to the Rebbe&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She will be well,” the Rebbe answered. This was more than just a blessing – the Rebbe worded it as a promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seeing that he was still worried, the Rebbe turned to a friend of my father-in-law’s and remarked, “Why is it her fault that he doesn’t trust me?” The Rebbe then took a piece of &lt;em&gt;challah &lt;/em&gt;bread from his table and sent it to my father-in-law, to bring back to me, before adding: “Tell Peretz that she will be completely healthy!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He soon brought the &lt;em&gt;challah &lt;/em&gt;back to me in Montreal, and – after two operations and eighteen blood transfusions – I slowly started coming back to myself. It took time but, little by little, I ended up fully recuperating and went on to have five more children, thank G-d.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during this episode that I was given an additional name – Chaya, which means “life” – a traditional practice for when someone is in a life-threatening situation. For years, when I met or corresponded with the Rebbe, he would emphasize that I had two names, and if I left out my new name and just wrote “Rivka” on a note to him, he would remind me to include it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the Rebbe would often inquire after my health when we had a private audience with him. We felt a sense of awe whenever we were in the Rebbe’s presence, but then he would ask about how I was feeling, or my diet, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular example of this happened years later, during a private audience before the Bar Mitzvah of Shimon, my second to youngest child. The Rebbe gave us the customary blessings for a Bar Mitzvah, and then turned to look at me very intensely. “And how are you doing – with your health?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that I felt exhausted. I had many children to take care of, and we also always had a lot of guests, so I was overtired and overworked. But the way the Rebbe posed the question took me aback, and I couldn’t respond at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Nu&lt;/em&gt;,” the Rebbe said simply. “It should be good – and there is no limit to how good something can be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I came home and told my mother about this exchange, she understood that something was not right, and insisted that I go to the doctor. After performing a physical, the doctor established that my iron levels were sixty percent lower than they should have been, and helped bring me back to proper health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only because the Rebbe had shown such concern that I realized there was an issue that needed to be addressed; otherwise, I probably would have just kept going until I collapsed. But when the Rebbe looked at me, he saw my condition better than I myself did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the closeness and the protection that I felt from the Rebbe. It saved my life, more than once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The matriarch of a large Chabad family, Mrs. Chaya Rivka Mochkin has resided in Crown Heights since 1956&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;. She was interviewed in April 2013.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ARGENTINA'S NON-PROPHET</title>
      <link>https://jemcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/636.-Vayakhel-5785.pdf</link>

      <description>In 1976, the Rebbe encouraged a young student to serve joyfully as his emissary. During Argentina’s crises, the Rebbe provided financial support and instructed to trust G‑d rather than focus on uncertainty. This guidance helped build a strong Jewish community and establish a leading school despit...</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I had come to New York from Argentina six years earlier to study in the Chabad &lt;em&gt;yeshivah&lt;/em&gt; in 770. By 1976, I was twenty-two years old, which made me one of the older students. I was concentrating fully on studying Torah, but on Thursday nights I would travel to other Torah institutions in the New York area – from nearby Boro Park, to upstate, in South Fallsburg – to give classes on &lt;em&gt;chasidic&lt;/em&gt; teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, I would have a private audience with the Rebbe before my birthday, but that year, as I was preparing to see the Rebbe, I was feeling bad about myself. I felt as though I wasn’t succeeding in my studies or the other activities I was involved in. Despite my efforts, there were some things that I just could not accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I included all this in the note I wrote to the Rebbe before the meeting, along with some other questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In regards to what you have written,” the Rebbe answered me, “complaining that you are not successful in this or that: Our Sages have said that ‘one who puts in effort will surely succeed.’ This was said to me,” – here the Rebbe referred directly to himself – “and to you, and to every other Jew. And so what you are describing cannot be. Since you are putting in effort, it cannot be that you’re not successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went on to say that any thought that brings a person to melancholy or depression “has to be thrown away,” since “sadness leads to despair and to a lack of enthusiasm; it wastes time, and decreases one’s trust in G-d.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Jew is supposed to serve G-d with joy, he explained, and that doesn’t apply only when one is studying Torah or praying. We are instructed to “Know G-d in all your ways” – everything we do is part of serving G-d, and that means that a Jew must be happy all the time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You write that you give classes,” the Rebbe continued, “that you helped out a fellow student, that what you have learned has an effect on other people. So you are succeeding. You are doing the work of our Rebbes and acting as their emissary. Therefore, when such thoughts arise, you should think that since you are an emissary of the Rebbes, there is no place for sadness!” The Rebbe concluded that he hoped to hear good news from me about doing my work joyfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I had been feeling very down before the audience, the Rebbe’s words lifted me up. They gave me a way forward, and a fresh perspective. I walked out feeling like a different person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, I was totally taken aback by how the Rebbe referred to me as an emissary – his “shliach,” because I knew that the Rebbe didn’t take words like that lightly. I was just a student who taught a weekly class, yet the Rebbe was empowering me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would soon become a shliach in the more typical sense of the word. In that same audience, I had also asked the Rebbe whether I should go back to Argentina in the summer, as part of Chabad’s rabbinic visitation program. The yeshivah had already given their approval, and now the Rebbe added his blessing that I go there “with joy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did so, and after we married, my wife and I moved to Argentina to serve permanently as shluchim. During our first few years, there was a lot of instability in the country. First there was a major economic crisis, and then, in 1982, the Falklands War broke out between Argentina and the United Kingdom. We were already in debt, and this made it even harder to raise the funds we needed for our activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, we had 500 copies of Thought of the Week, a weekly Torah publication we would distribute, that needed to be picked up from the printer – but I didn’t even have enough money for the bus to take me there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t give you anything now,” said one donor. “There’s a war going on!” He had survived the war in Europe, and was worried about the future. Close to despair myself, I picked up the phone again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, you couldn’t dial New York directly; instead, you’d call the telephone company’s international operator and they would schedule a time to call you back to make the connection. This could be two days later, and they never called back on time. Then, you’d have to hope you would get through to 770, where the phones were always busy. Getting Rabbi Mordechai Hodakov, the Rebbe’s chief secretary, on the phone was another odyssey in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I called. Right away, I got through to the servicio internacional. Right away, they connected me with America. Right away, the phone in 770 started ringing. Right away, one of the other secretaries picked up, and then right away I was speaking with Rabbi Hodakov. I felt as if all the gates of heaven were opening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I explained that people are scared about what is going on in the country and don’t want to support our work. “What am I supposed to do?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll get back to you,” Rabbi Hodakov said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five minutes later, the phone rang; it was another miracle that he got through to me so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Rebbe decided that he will give you a loan,” Rabbi Hodakov informed me. I had asked for financial help a couple of months earlier, but hadn’t even brought it up on this call. The Rebbe had originally earmarked $2,000, but then changed it to $3,000. “Repay it when you can,” Rabbi Hodakov added. He did eventually get the full sum back, but at the time, that $3,000 solved many problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Rabbi Hodakov gave me the Rebbe’s answer to my question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t send you and the other shluchim to deliberate on the country’s economic policy. Your mission is to spread Judaism while trusting in G-d.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of course,” he continued, “people will ask what you think about the future. You should answer that you are not a prophet, and that your mission is to spread Judaism while trusting in G-d.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days after that, a friend set up a meeting for me with the president of a bank here in Argentina. We had never met before, but he knew who I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What do you need?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told him we needed $25,000 in order to pay off all our debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come back tomorrow,” he replied. “We’ll give it to you.” That was the first we had ever received a single donation of that size – and it came at a most unlikely time, in the middle of the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rebbe’s instructions became my golden rule: I trust in G-d instead of making calculations. If I would attempt to predict the future, with all of Argentina’s constant crises and economic changes, I would go crazy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the big economic crisis of 2002, I just stopped reading the paper. I didn’t want to know anything about it. In 2020, during the worst of the pandemic, we started building a new school. Instead of delaying the project, we went ahead with putting up six and a half thousand square meters of construction. Today, the students who come to learn in that building are sitting in one of the nicest Jewish schools in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rabbi Tzvi Grunblatt is the director of Chabad in Argentina, which today includes approximately sixty institutions across the country. He was interviewed in October of 2016 and November of 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
